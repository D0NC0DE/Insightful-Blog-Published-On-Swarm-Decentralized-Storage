Artificial intelligence will help realize ideas such as human-robot collaboration and autonomous cars, and it will help computers not only understand human speech and gestures, but also our emotions.</p><p id="introduction">The true power and rapid momentum of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years have best been demonstrated in use cases such as <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_page.php?id=6859" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">IBM’s Watson</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/what-we-learned-in-seoul-with-alphago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Google’s AlphaGo</a>. In both of them, AI managed to beat the human contenders in Jeopardy and Go. The capability of AI to beat humans at social games may seem fruitless and insignificant, but it demonstrates the exceptional sophistication of AI, and its ability to imitate and outperform humans in solving highly complex tasks.</p><p>Artificial intelligence can be defined as intelligent computer systems with the ability to think and learn (in a way that resembles humans). An AI technology stack consists of various tools, techniques, and algorithms. AI applications range from neural networks to genetic algorithms, from pattern and speech recognition to machine and deep learning.</p><p>Current and past achievements point to a very exciting future for artificial intelligence technology. Read on to find out more about risks, challenges, applications, global economic impacts, AI industries, top jobs involving artificial intelligence, and how the technology will change the future of many fields.</p><h2 id="history-of-artificial-intelligence">History of artificial intelligence</h2><p>Real-world applications of AI such as autonomous cars, personal assistants (smart speakers), intelligent robots, and cognitive automation are all possible thanks to AI’s ability to correctly interpret environmental data and learn from it to perform specific tasks such as pattern recognition or anomaly detection.</p><p>For over 50 years developments in AI were slow, and it remained mainly an academic discipline. Recently, due to the high availability of data (Big Data) and improvements in computation power, AI has gained momentum and revolutionized many business areas and industries.</p><p>The slow <a href="https://pixelplex.io/blog/what-is-ai-and-how-does-it-work/">progress of AI</a> was caused by the initial focus of research efforts on replicating human intelligence. So-called expert systems operated with collections of rules that attempted to formalize and reconstruct the human way of thinking. Despite many advantages, such systems perform poorly in applications with high impact such as image recognition.</p><p>Modern AI systems, on the other hand, are based on neural networks and deep learning. They are versatile and achieve superior performance in many tasks. AI has successfully become an indispensable part of our lives and caused a significant global economic leap forward.</p><h2 id="the-global-economic-impact-of-artificial-intelligence">The global economic impact of artificial intelligence</h2><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-global-economic-impact-of-artificial-intelligence.png" alt="A robotic arm holding the Earth next to an AI icon" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-global-economic-impact-of-artificial-intelligence.png" alt="A robotic arm holding the Earth next to an AI icon" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>In 2015 only one in ten companies used AI technology.

These risks relate to trust, the ethics of AI-driven decisions, data privacy, and the transparency of AI-delivered outcomes.</p><h3>Trust</h3><p>Ultimately, AI does not and cannot have human moral values and that fact feeds our distrust in these systems. For example, despite the high level of accuracy in AI-generated medical diagnosis, we still have doctors in the loop to verify the results, making sure they are trustworthy. Having them present the results to patients is also the common practice as humans can provide empathy and walk the person through the best options for treatment.</p><h3>Ethics</h3><p>AI presents huge ethical concerns in three areas. Due to the need to collect large amounts of data, there are many concerns about the possibility of privacy obstructions and surveillance. AI-driven results are often influenced by biased data, which may lead to discrimination.</p><p>Artificial intelligence lacks human judgment capabilities and its conclusions and results are based only on the logical relationship between inputs and outputs found in the training data. Lack of judgment may lead to decisions that can impede the integrity of human life, and once this happens, who do we deem responsible?</p><h3>Data privacy and security</h3><p>Data privacy and security are the largest limiting factors to the full adoption of AI in applications such as government, <a href="https://pixelplex.io/blog/how-ai-shapes-healthcare-industry/">healthcare</a>, and consumer devices. In an era where cyber-attacks cost businesses billions in litigation and remediation, AI-related privacy concerns must be the first to check off the to-do list when building your smart digital solution.</p><h3>Algorithm transparency</h3><p>As AI technology is adopted in fields where humans were traditionally making decisions, the explainability of AI algorithms and transparency of their operation is becoming increasingly important. Nowadays, many AI methods act as a “black box” and there is no clarity into how they produce their results. Although those results are very accurate, we will need to invest much more effort into increasing their explainability.</p><p>Despite the risks associated with AI today, in the future, continuing technological developments in the field will lead to their minimization, and eventually their complete mitigation. Many of these challenges can be already avoided by partnering with an experienced team of machine learning and development experts who can suggest the best roadmap and tools for whatever AI project you have in mind. Ultimately, the promising benefits offered by artificial intelligence in the future will far outweigh the challenges and risks of today.</p><h2 id="industries-that-make-use-of-ai">Industries that make use of AI</h2><p>AI influences <a href="https://pixelplex.io/blog/examples-of-ai-throughout-industries/">many industries</a> and is predicted to gain even more exposure In the future by establishing its presence in consumer electronics, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, and other business verticals.</p><h3>Consumer electronics</h3><p>In consumer electronics, AI technology is opening up a new era of user experience.
