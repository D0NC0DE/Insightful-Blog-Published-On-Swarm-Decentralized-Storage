Stablecoins prove to be a promising alternative as they complement crypto features with the stability of established fiat currencies.</p><p id="introduction">Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile assets. The price of Bitcoin went from 2,000 USD to over 20,000 USD in 2017 and fell back to below 6,000 USD in the following year. It has since restored its value (over $51,000 USD at the time of 2021) but continues to fluctuate in price. Showing relative stability over a narrow timeframe, it is likely to remain more volatile than well-grounded national currencies and physical commodities such as gold.</p><p>Since even the top-of-the-market cryptocurrencies are not sustainable, most individuals and investors are reluctant to trust them with their holdings because of the risks involved. Crypto volatility may attract market players looking to benefit from price appreciation and trading. However, it is still a major factor preventing cryptocurrencies from being thrust into the mainstream world of payments.</p><p>Stablecoins are very likely to bridge this gap and serve as non-volatile blockchain-powered digital assets with the benefits of crypto and fiat currency combined. Read on to find out more about stablecoins, their different types, real-world applications, and examples of stablecoins currently available on the market.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-stablecoin">What is a stablecoin?</h2><p>Stablecoins marry the celebrated decentralized and secure nature of cryptocurrencies with the stability of fiat currencies and valuable commodities. As the name suggests, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility by locking it to an asset or a currency with a more stable value.</p><p>The price of traditional crypto coins depends on fluctuations in a marketplace with volatile supply and demand. Crypto stablecoins are different from other cryptocurrencies, which have no inbuilt mechanism to minimize exchange rate volatility. Most of them are designed to be equal to USD, the world’s leading reserve currency. As a prominent example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tether</a> is a USD-backed stablecoin that is actively traded on public markets with a reliable exchange rate.</p><p>In 2021, the market capitalization of stable coins sky-rocketed reaching <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1255835/stablecoin-market-capitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">$100 billion.</a></p><a class="simple-link-box" href="/services/blockchain-consulting/"><p>Check with our blockchain consultants to investigate your stablecoin use case</p><span></span></a><h2 id="the-various-types-of-stablecoins">The various types of stablecoins</h2><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-various-types-of-stablecoins.jpg" alt="A person exploring types of stablecoins using a binoculars" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-various-types-of-stablecoins.jpg" alt="A person exploring types of stablecoins using a binoculars" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Stablecoins are classified as asset-backed and non-asset-backed (seigniorage). The first type can be backed by fiat, other cryptocurrencies, or commodities. Although susceptible to volatility risks of the underlying asset, the price of asset-backed coins is unlikely to drop below its value. A seigniorage-style stablecoin design, on the other hand, utilizes special algorithms to manage its supply similar to how money is issued and disposed of in a traditional banking system.</p><h3 id="fiat-backed-stablecoins">Fiat-backed stablecoins</h3><p>Fiat-backed stablecoins or so-called off-chain collateralized stablecoins are crypto tokens associated with the value of a specific fiat currency. They are dispersed by a central issuer that holds an amount of fiat currency in reserve proportionate to the number of issued tokens.</p><blockquote><p>These tokens have their value fixed at a 1:1 ratio to a fiat currency, for example, USD or Euro. In a typical fiat-backed stablecoin scenario, the issuer might hold one million USD and distribute one million tokens worth one USD each. Users are free to trade these coins, just as they would a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. The difference is that the holder can redeem their equivalent in USD at any time.</p></blockquote><p>The centralized nature of fiat-backed stablecoins can prove to be a serious disadvantage as there is no way you can be sure the issuer holds the matching amount of backing funds in their reserve.</p><h3 id="cryptocurrency-backed-stablecoins">Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins</h3><p>Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins are very similar to their fiat-backed counterparts. They also peg their value to an asset. However, instead of fiat, other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum are set up as collateral.</p><p>To compensate for the volatility of the underlying tokens, the amount of reserve cryptocurrency used to issue a stablecoin is greater than its value. Say, if a stablecoin is pegged to Ethereum with a market price of 10,000 USD, then an equivalent of 20,000 USD in ETH can be used as collateral to counter market fluctuations. Smart contracts are used to govern the issuance process and maintain the reserve of crypto coins.</p><p>The main advantage of cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins is their decentralized nature, with no need for a custodian to control disbursement and exchange of funds. All of the network members participate in the lifecycle of the issued stablecoins which provides higher liquidity. The monetary policy and governance are therefore in the hands of voters who take part in supporting market price stability.</p><h3 id="commodity-backed-stablecoins">Commodity-backed stablecoins</h3><p>Commodity-backed stablecoins are backed by other kinds of interchangeable assets, such as precious metals. The most common commodity to be collateralized is gold, but there are also stablecoins backed by oil, real estate, and baskets of various precious metals. Stablecoins backed by commodities such as precious metals are much less likely to see their value inflated than fiat-backed stablecoins.</p><p>Holders of commodity-backed stablecoins can redeem their stablecoins at the conversion rate to take possession of real assets. The cost of maintaining the stability of the stablecoin equates to the cost of storing and protecting the commodity backing it.</p><h3 id="non-collateralized-stablecoins">Non-collateralized (seigniorage-style) stablecoins</h3><p>Non-collateralized stablecoins make use of a Seigniorage Shares system. These stablecoins employ algorithms to control market value. Algorithms can change the supply volume of coins to maintain their price.</p><p>The smart contracts that regulate the price of non-collateralized stablecoins have an approach similar to the central bank that prints and destroys its currency. Smart contracts sell tokens if the price falls below the peg, and supply tokens to the market if the value increases. In this way, the token remains stable and holds its peg.</p><p>Since there is no reliance on collateral, non-collateralized stablecoins are independent of any central authority. Smart contracts are, in general, more trustable, since the peg is tied to an algorithm and not to collateral. The seigniorage mechanisms are far more complex than collateralized stablecoins. However, the nature of the system requires a constant demand for stablecoins, which is not always guaranteed.</p><h2 id="common-stablecoin-use-cases">Common stablecoin use cases</h2><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/common-stablecoin-use-cases.jpg" alt="A person carrying a physical coin to make a payment" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/common-stablecoin-use-cases.jpg" alt="A person carrying a physical coin to make a payment" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Stablecoins are used in the same way as regular cryptocurrency but provide additional benefits in some situations. They are mostly applied to store funds and complete regular transactions, support peer-to-peer payments, and bring more value to cryptocurrency exchange. Stablecoins are a great asset when it comes to mitigating the side effects in the aftermath of a cryptocurrency crash.</p><h3 id="countering-damages-caused-by-market-instability">Countering damages caused by market instability</h3><p>One of the real-world applications of stablecoin is to minimize the losses caused by volatile cryptocurrencies. Traders can quickly trade the failing cryptocurrency for fiat-backed or asset-backed stablecoins to protect the value of their holdings.</p><p>Trading volatile cryptocurrency for stablecoins is similar to investing in assets like gold and storing them in treasuries in times of an unpredictable market. In the crypto world, stablecoins provide traders with a safe harbor, allowing them to reduce the risks without having to leave the crypto ecosystem.</p><h3 id="daily-transactions">Daily transactions</h3><p>Like other fiat currencies, with the help of stablecoin wallets, this type of cryptocurrency can be used for anything from buying morning coffee and transferring funds to family members, to overseas payments. It could be the most effective method of making international money transfers in a cheap and joined-up way.</p><h3 id="periodic-payments">Periodic payments</h3><p>Stablecoins allow using smart financial contracts that are enforceable over time. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with rules and conditions programmed into them. They are a great fit for automating recurring payments. Transactions in stablecoins are traceable, transparent, and irreversible, making them ideal for salary and loan payments, rent payments, and subscriptions.</p><p>For example, an employer can deploy a smart contract that automatically transfers stablecoins as salary to employees at the end of the month. It is also helpful for organizations that have employees all over the world. Stablecoins reduce the high fees and the lengthy processes involved in exchanging fiat currencies.</p><h3 id="crypto-trading">Crypto trading</h3><p>Due to strict regulations, there are very few cryptocurrency exchanges that support fiat cryptocurrencies. However, the use of stablecoins offers a solution to this problem because they serve as a <a href="https://pixelplex.io/work/cryptocurrency-trading-arbitrage-bot-and-platform/">crypto-fiat trading</a> pair. Users can trade with USD-backed stablecoins instead of actual dollars. These traits may lead to the accelerated adoption of cryptocurrency trading in the conventional world of asset exchange.</p><h2 id="stablecoin-examples">Stablecoin examples</h2><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stablecoin-examples.jpg" alt="A person next to several piles of coins" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stablecoin-examples.jpg" alt="A person next to several piles of coins" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>The crypto market is saturated with stablecoins each offering its own benefits. Most companies build their tokens on Ethereum and peg them to either fiat currency or other valuable assets. Let’s run through some of the most successful stablecoins out there.</p><h3>Tether (USDT)</h3><p><a href="https://tether.to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Tether</a> (USDT), formerly known as RealCoin, is one of the oldest stablecoins. It is a crypto-asset that leverages distributed ledger technology to allow individuals and organizations to store, send, and receive digital tokens pegged to dollars, euros, and yen. The Tether currency unit is issued and redeemed using the Omni Layer protocol that runs on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Tether is designed to reduce cryptocurrency volatility by maintaining a 1:1 reserve ratio between the token and the associated fiat currency.</p><h3>USD Coin (USDC)</h3><p><a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">USD Coin</a> (USDC) was launched by Circle and Coinbase, both leading cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms with major investors. USDC is a USD-backed stablecoin running on the Ethereum blockchain. The design is based on the open-source fiat stablecoin framework developed by CENTRE, an open-source initiative established by Circle.

The price of Bitcoin went from 2,000 USD to over 20,000 USD in 2017 and fell back to below 6,000 USD in the following year. It has since restored its value (over $51,000 USD at the time of 2021) but continues to fluctuate in price. Showing relative stability over a narrow timeframe, it is likely to remain more volatile than well-grounded national currencies and physical commodities such as gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince even the top-of-the-market cryptocurrencies are not sustainable, most individuals and investors are reluctant to trust them with their holdings because of the risks involved. Crypto volatility may attract market players looking to benefit from price appreciation and trading. However, it is still a major factor preventing cryptocurrencies from being thrust into the mainstream world of payments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStablecoins are very likely to bridge this gap and serve as non-volatile blockchain-powered digital assets with the benefits of crypto and fiat currency combined. Read on to find out more about stablecoins, their different types, real-world applications, and examples of stablecoins currently available on the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-a-stablecoin\"\u003eWhat is a stablecoin?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStablecoins marry the celebrated decentralized and secure nature of cryptocurrencies with the stability of fiat currencies and valuable commodities. As the name suggests, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility by locking it to an asset or a currency with a more stable value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe price of traditional crypto coins depends on fluctuations in a marketplace with volatile supply and demand. Crypto stablecoins are different from other cryptocurrencies, which have no inbuilt mechanism to minimize exchange rate volatility. Most of them are designed to be equal to USD, the world’s leading reserve currency. As a prominent example, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eTether\u003c/a\u003e is a USD-backed stablecoin that is actively traded on public markets with a reliable exchange rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2021, the market capitalization of stable coins sky-rocketed reaching \u003ca href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1255835/stablecoin-market-capitalization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"\u003e$100 billion.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Check with our blockchain consultants to investigate your stablecoin use case","url":"https://pixelplex.io/services/blockchain-consulting/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-various-types-of-stablecoins\"\u003eThe various types of stablecoins\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-various-types-of-stablecoins.jpg\" alt=\"A person exploring types of stablecoins using a binoculars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStablecoins are classified as asset-backed and non-asset-backed (seigniorage). The first type can be backed by fiat, other cryptocurrencies, or commodities. Although susceptible to volatility risks of the underlying asset, the price of asset-backed coins is unlikely to drop below its value. A seigniorage-style stablecoin design, on the other hand, utilizes special algorithms to manage its supply similar to how money is issued and disposed of in a traditional banking system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"fiat-backed-stablecoins\"\u003eFiat-backed stablecoins\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiat-backed stablecoins or so-called off-chain collateralized stablecoins are crypto tokens associated with the value of a specific fiat currency. They are dispersed by a central issuer that holds an amount of fiat currency in reserve proportionate to the number of issued tokens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese tokens have their value fixed at a 1:1 ratio to a fiat currency, for example, USD or Euro. In a typical fiat-backed stablecoin scenario, the issuer might hold one million USD and distribute one million tokens worth one USD each. Users are free to trade these coins, just as they would a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. The difference is that the holder can redeem their equivalent in USD at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe centralized nature of fiat-backed stablecoins can prove to be a serious disadvantage as there is no way you can be sure the issuer holds the matching amount of backing funds in their reserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"cryptocurrency-backed-stablecoins\"\u003eCryptocurrency-backed stablecoins\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrency-backed stablecoins are very similar to their fiat-backed counterparts. They also peg their value to an asset. However, instead of fiat, other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum are set up as collateral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo compensate for the volatility of the underlying tokens, the amount of reserve cryptocurrency used to issue a stablecoin is greater than its value. Say, if a stablecoin is pegged to Ethereum with a market price of 10,000 USD, then an equivalent of 20,000 USD in ETH can be used as collateral to counter market fluctuations. Smart contracts are used to govern the issuance process and maintain the reserve of crypto coins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main advantage of cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins is their decentralized nature, with no need for a custodian to control disbursement and exchange of funds. All of the network members participate in the lifecycle of the issued stablecoins which provides higher liquidity. The monetary policy and governance are therefore in the hands of voters who take part in supporting market price stability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"commodity-backed-stablecoins\"\u003eCommodity-backed stablecoins\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommodity-backed stablecoins are backed by other kinds of interchangeable assets, such as precious metals. The most common commodity to be collateralized is gold, but there are also stablecoins backed by oil, real estate, and baskets of various precious metals. Stablecoins backed by commodities such as precious metals are much less likely to see their value inflated than fiat-backed stablecoins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolders of commodity-backed stablecoins can redeem their stablecoins at the conversion rate to take possession of real assets. The cost of maintaining the stability of the stablecoin equates to the cost of storing and protecting the commodity backing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"non-collateralized-stablecoins\"\u003eNon-collateralized (seigniorage-style) stablecoins\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon-collateralized stablecoins make use of a Seigniorage Shares system. These stablecoins employ algorithms to control market value. Algorithms can change the supply volume of coins to maintain their price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smart contracts that regulate the price of non-collateralized stablecoins have an approach similar to the central bank that prints and destroys its currency. Smart contracts sell tokens if the price falls below the peg, and supply tokens to the market if the value increases. In this way, the token remains stable and holds its peg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince there is no reliance on collateral, non-collateralized stablecoins are independent of any central authority. Smart contracts are, in general, more trustable, since the peg is tied to an algorithm and not to collateral. The seigniorage mechanisms are far more complex than collateralized stablecoins. However, the nature of the system requires a constant demand for stablecoins, which is not always guaranteed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"common-stablecoin-use-cases\"\u003eCommon stablecoin use cases\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/common-stablecoin-use-cases.jpg\" alt=\"A person carrying a physical coin to make a payment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStablecoins are used in the same way as regular cryptocurrency but provide additional benefits in some situations. They are mostly applied to store funds and complete regular transactions, support peer-to-peer payments, and bring more value to cryptocurrency exchange. Stablecoins are a great asset when it comes to mitigating the side effects in the aftermath of a cryptocurrency crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"countering-damages-caused-by-market-instability\"\u003eCountering damages caused by market instability\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the real-world applications of stablecoin is to minimize the losses caused by volatile cryptocurrencies. Traders can quickly trade the failing cryptocurrency for fiat-backed or asset-backed stablecoins to protect the value of their holdings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrading volatile cryptocurrency for stablecoins is similar to investing in assets like gold and storing them in treasuries in times of an unpredictable market. In the crypto world, stablecoins provide traders with a safe harbor, allowing them to reduce the risks without having to leave the crypto ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"daily-transactions\"\u003eDaily transactions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike other fiat currencies, with the help of stablecoin wallets, this type of cryptocurrency can be used for anything from buying morning coffee and transferring funds to family members, to overseas payments. It could be the most effective method of making international money transfers in a cheap and joined-up way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"periodic-payments\"\u003ePeriodic payments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStablecoins allow using smart financial contracts that are enforceable over time. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with rules and conditions programmed into them. They are a great fit for automating recurring payments. Transactions in stablecoins are traceable, transparent, and irreversible, making them ideal for salary and loan payments, rent payments, and subscriptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, an employer can deploy a smart contract that automatically transfers stablecoins as salary to employees at the end of the month. It is also helpful for organizations that have employees all over the world. Stablecoins reduce the high fees and the lengthy processes involved in exchanging fiat currencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"crypto-trading\"\u003eCrypto trading\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to strict regulations, there are very few cryptocurrency exchanges that support fiat cryptocurrencies. However, the use of stablecoins offers a solution to this problem because they serve as a \u003ca href=\"https://pixelplex.io/work/cryptocurrency-trading-arbitrage-bot-and-platform/\"\u003ecrypto-fiat trading\u003c/a\u003e pair.
