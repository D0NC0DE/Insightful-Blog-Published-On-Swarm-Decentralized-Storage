You will find out why it is a good idea to create your own NFT platform and what the entire development process looks like.</p><div class="slide"><p><iframe title="NFT Marketplace: How to develop one?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/29EYVzg9cII?feature=oembed" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe></p></div><h2 id="what-is-an-nft">What is an NFT? Yes, once again</h2><p>You may have come across an explanation of NFTs in the news or social media a thousand times (a big hello to the TikTok generation), and in all probability, you’ve learned it by heart. But practice makes perfect — so let’s solidify that knowledge once again.</p><p>A <a href="https://pixelplex.io/blog/non-fungible-tokens/">non-fungible token</a> (NFT) is a non-interchangeable digital asset created on the blockchain. It represents real-world objects like art, music, virtual lands, collectibles, videos, GIFs, images, and in-game items.</p><p>NFTs are a ground-breaking notion in the crypto space. They enable artists and content creators to easily monetize their works, without having to rely on galleries and auction houses. This means that artists no longer need to turn to intermediaries to sell their wares. Instead, they have the ability to sell them directly to the consumer in the form of an NFT and get paid for what belongs to them.</p><p>As far as NFT buyers/owners are concerned, what’s noteworthy is that they can enjoy the uniqueness of the acquired NFT. Plus, given that non-fungible tokens are based on the blockchain, it’s possible to track their entire history. This provides better transparency as well as provenance and verification of their authenticity.</p><p>Whether you like it or not, NFTs are here and they are here to stay. So instead of grumbling and nagging, perhaps it would be wiser to come up with your own idea of what to tokenize 😉</p><a class="simple-link-box" href="/blog/flow-vs-ethereum-comparison-best-platforms-for-nft/"><p>Our blockchain experts have made an exhaustive comparison between the Ethereum and Flow blockchains. Check it out!</p><span></span></a><h2 id="what-to-consider-before-creating-nfts">What to consider before creating NFTs</h2><p>You might be surprised to learn that the process of creating an NFT is rather straightforward and doesn’t require particular skills or extensive expertise — literally anyone is able to successfully launch an NFT campaign.</p><p>Before that, though, you will have to give due consideration to some points.</p><p>First of all, you are required to <strong>choose the blockchain</strong> that you will use for issuing your NFTs. These days, the number of blockchains used in NFT campaigns is abundant. Apart from Ethereum — the leading one — you can consider many other options such as Flow, Tron, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, EOS, Tezos, and WAX. Take into account that each of them possesses its own token standard, compatible marketplaces, and wallet services. So, if you create an NFT on Flow, for instance, you will be able to sell it only on platforms that provide support for Flow’s assets.</p><p>As well as this, it’s important to <strong>bear in mind gas fees</strong>. The majority of marketplaces support NFTs that operate on the Ethereum blockchain. Consequently, the increasing popularity of Ethereum is resulting in higher gas fees.</p><p>There is a viable solution to this, though: you’ll be better off if you select the less (or least) active times of the week. It’s been <a href="https://medium.com/dextf/ethereum-how-to-save-even-more-on-gas-price-with-a-weekly-plan-c6689ac09fe6" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">established</a> that on average the best time to submit transactions and thereby save on Ethereum gas fees is between 2 pm and 8 pm NYC time.</p><p>There is one more tip we are eager to share with you. If you are going to mint your NFT art on the Ethereum blockchain, for instance, you will need to <strong>choose a suitable wallet</strong> that will provide support to Ethereum-based assets and be compatible with ERC-721 standards. Currently, the most notable wallets are MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase.</p><a class="simple-link-box" href="/nft-development/"><p>Need a trustworthy partner to foster your NFT development? We are here to help you</p><span></span></a><h2 id="how-to-create-nfts">How to create NFTs</h2><p>These days, you can come across multiple NFT marketplaces that will help you create your NFT art pieces and join the big game. As of today, the leading and most widely-used of these are OpenSea, Rarible, Mintable, Foundation, KnownOrigin, AtomicMarket, BakerySwap, Portion, Nifty Gateway, and NBA Top Shot.</p><p>In this particular article, we will look into how to create, sell, and buy NFTs on <a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">OpenSea</a> so that you have a good understanding of what the process looks like here.</p><p>Spoiler alert: it’s a cinch.</p><p>Now let’s check out the sequence of steps needed to successfully launch your NFTs.</p><p><em>NB! All the screenshots in the article have been taken from the official OpenSea website</em></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Once you have set up an OpenSea account, go to your profile and choose “<strong>My Collections</strong>”. Note that if this is your first ever listing on OpenSea you will be asked to pay gas fees associated with the setup of your account.</li></ul><p><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-11.png" alt="The UI of User profile tab on OpenSea website" width="808" height="704" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-11.png" alt="The UI of User profile tab on OpenSea website" width="808" height="704" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Choose “<strong>Create a Collection</strong>” to launch a new collection. NB! When you have created several collections, you will be able to view them here too.</li></ul><p><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-8.png" alt="The UI of My Collections tab on OpenSea website" width="1897" height="1464" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-8.png" alt="The UI of My Collections tab on OpenSea website" width="1897" height="1464" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Provide a collection name and description and upload an image logo. It is always possible to update these details since you are not making NFTs at this point.</li></ul><p><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-6.png" alt="The UI of Create collection tab on OpenSea website" width="1050" height="1687" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-6.png" alt="The UI of Create collection tab on OpenSea website" width="1050" height="1687" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><ul><li>Now that you have created your collection, you can get down to adding items to it. Select “<strong>Add Items</strong>”. You can use a host of formats for NFT art works, including images, audio, videos, and even 3D models. Remember that you’ll have to consider crucial parameters such as accepted NFT file formats and sizes. The maximum file size is 40MB, though the platform’s admins recommend keeping it to 20MB to ensure faster load times.</li></ul><p><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-7.png" alt="The UI of Collection details tab on OpenSea website" width="1006" height="1042" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-7.png" alt="The UI of Collection details tab on OpenSea website" width="1006" height="1042" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><ul><li>If you wish to update your banner image, you should choose the pencil icon in the top right corner. Given that your banner will look different on different devices, try to make sure that the dimensions are around 1400 x 400 pixels. As well as this, it’s best to avoid any text.</li></ul><p><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-5.png" alt="The UI of Collection details tab on OpenSea website" width="1999" height="908" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-5.png" alt="The UI of Collection details tab on OpenSea website" width="1999" height="908" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Once you have uploaded your NFT files, you can also decide on a category for your collection. This will be helpful for other platform users to search for your file on OpenSea. It’s also necessary to provide social media links to your project. You can include links to the following resources: your personal website, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, Medium, and Telegram.</li></ul><p><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-4.png" alt="The UI of NFT collection details tab on OpenSea website" width="1200" height="1378" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-4.png" alt="The UI of NFT collection details tab on OpenSea website" width="1200" height="1378" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><ul><li aria-level="1">When you are done with all these fields, you can decide on the percentage for royalties. To do this, go to “<strong>My Collection</strong>” and specify the percentage — it is possible to set a fee up to 10%. Then provide the payout address where you wish to receive those fees. The OpenSea platform cannot split royalties to multiple addresses.</li></ul><p><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-2.png" alt="The UI of Fee settings tab on OpenSea website" width="1556" height="686" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-2.png" alt="The UI of Fee settings tab on OpenSea website" width="1556" height="686" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>As you can see, the process of NFT art creation on OpenSea is quite simple. And it is not only OpenSea that allows for effortless NFT creation.

Share your digital works via Discord and Reddit</strong>. Apart from simply chatting, Discord provides professional features such as sharing and storing different materials and documents.

In the tech world, with every innovation comes the possibility of fraud. And unfortunately, NFTs are no exception.</p><p>The crypto space has been dealing with scams for years already and with the advent of NFTs, wrongdoers found a new loophole for their skulduggery. Being a new and underexplored trend, NFTs have become the target of a number of scams.</p><p>Below we provide an overview of the most common NFT scams that you need to know about when creating, selling, and buying NFTs.</p><h3>Artist impersonation</h3><p>Artist impersonation has been the most prevalent scam so far. It refers to the situation where someone steals a work from a digital artist and presents it as their own. Scam artists normally sell popular NFT artworks at a low price and manage to take in credulous fans.</p><p>A good example of this is the recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/01/banksy-website-promotes-fake-nft-in-apparent-hack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Banksy scam</a> where the buyer paid more than $300,000 in ETH for a fake Banksy NFT (luckily, the hacker returned all the money to the collector ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).</p><p>To prevent this from happening, it is necessary to check if the artist you are buying from or the artwork itself is verified. This is possible to do with the help of special NFT provenance platforms.</p><h3>Phony storefronts</h3><p>Multiple fake storefronts have become a widespread thing in the NFT space. Their URLs usually look the same as those of the original stores. On top of that, the site itself is almost identical to the normal one. Wrongdoers might thereby trick you into buying a fake NFT or granting them your private key.</p><p>Watch out for suspicious URLs and the way in which you are directed to the website. Additionally, if you have run into a fake storefront, report it immediately.</p><h3>Fake giveaways/airdrops</h3><p>Crypto has always been a magnet for fake airdrops. Thousands of such scams are reported on a daily basis. Scammers use popular brands and personalities associated with cryptos and target enthusiasts by offering them free NFTs, tokens, and other cryptocurrencies. One of the most <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/scams-and-fraud-bubble-up-as-nft-mania-takes-hold-2021-03-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">infamous cases</a> so far was the fake giveaway of Rarible tokens.</p><p>As sad as it sounds, this trend is bound to continue. Scammers make use of communities on social media platforms such as Instagram, Discord, and Telegram and try to catch the attention of users with tempting offers, such as giving away fake and non-existent NFTs for free.</p><p>If somebody sends you a link to join such a community, simply verify it by searching on Google or Twitter. If there is no information about them on the official websites/pages of marketplaces, this means that those accounts are fake.</p><p>These are just some of the examples of existing scams. Forewarned is forearmed — be careful and don’t take the bait!</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2><p>Non-fungible tokens open up new and unlimited horizons for artists and collectors. Their popularity is growing at breakneck speed and judging by this it’s safe to say that NFTs are here to stay. Though they are still nascent and face some challenges, improvements are being made on a regular basis. For now, remember that discretion is the better part of valor — so try to avoid any doubtful or suspicious NFT-related activities which might lead to unfavorable consequences.</p><p>If you are a newcomer in the sphere and eager to kickstart your NFT journey, we have you covered.

They enable artists and content creators to easily monetize their works, without having to rely on galleries and auction houses. This means that artists no longer need to turn to intermediaries to sell their wares. Instead, they have the ability to sell them directly to the consumer in the form of an NFT and get paid for what belongs to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as NFT buyers/owners are concerned, what’s noteworthy is that they can enjoy the uniqueness of the acquired NFT.

These days, the number of blockchains used in NFT campaigns is abundant. Apart from Ethereum — the leading one — you can consider many other options such as Flow, Tron, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, EOS, Tezos, and WAX. Take into account that each of them possesses its own token standard, compatible marketplaces, and wallet services. So, if you create an NFT on Flow, for instance, you will be able to sell it only on platforms that provide support for Flow’s assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as this, it’s important to \u003cstrong\u003ebear in mind gas fees\u003c/strong\u003e.

Consequently, the increasing popularity of Ethereum is resulting in higher gas fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a viable solution to this, though: you’ll be better off if you select the less (or least) active times of the week.
