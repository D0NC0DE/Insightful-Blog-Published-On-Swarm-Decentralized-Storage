Many companies, unable to ignore Bitcoin’s rising popularity and technological advances, have begun to embrace crypto payments. But how does it all work?</p><p id="introduction">Over the years, humankind has created and used all manner of payment systems, from food barter and precious metals to metal coins and paper money. These days, though, performing a monetary transaction is as simple as swiping a card! While most transactions are carried out through government-regulated systems, the world of finance and investment has witnessed the ascent of a new payment method — cryptocurrency.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies are virtual digital assets that leverage a peer-to-peer system called the blockchain. <a id="articleservice" href="https://pixelplex.io/services/blockchain-consulting/">Blockchain technology</a> applies cryptography to create new units and protect each transaction. Operating on a decentralized network, cryptocurrencies have proved to be a great alternative to traditional currencies.</p><h2 id="why-consider-using-crypto">Why consider using crypto?</h2><p>Many tech-savvy people hear about crypto and wonder what the hype is about. We’ll try to address this question by listing a few advantages of using it.</p><h3>Ownership</h3><p>Crypto is the only electronic cash system that allows you to hold your account independently. Due to the decentralized nature of the currency, neither a bank nor the government has any control over it — so you are the sole, independent owner of your crypto.</p><h3>Accessibility</h3><p>There are <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">4.66 billion</a> active internet users as of January 2021. However, not all of them can access banking, debit cards, or credit cards. Individuals who are left out of the traditional financial system can therefore use the cryptocurrency market instead for their transactions. Anyone with access to a smartphone or computer can send and receive Bitcoins seamlessly.</p><h3>Instant settlement</h3><p>Cryptocurrency uses the blockchain to make quick payments and money transfers. With a smart device and an internet connection, you can become your own bank and get a quick settlement on any transaction. While credit card transactions take up to 48 hours to settle, a Bitcoin transaction can be completed in approximately <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-a-bitcoin-transaction-take" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">10 minutes</a>.</p><h3>Fraud-proof</h3><p>When cryptocurrency is generated, all confirmed transactions are saved in a public ledger. Crypto’s blockchain technology uses encryption and <a id="articleservice" href="https://pixelplex.io/smart-contract-development-audit/">smart contracts</a>, making it fraud-free and virtually unhackable. The coin owners’ identities are encrypted to maintain privacy without losing track of who has made the transaction. Owing to the immutable nature of the blockchain, Bitcoin records are maintained accurately and cannot be tampered with.</p><h2 id="in-which-countries-is-bitcoin-accepted-as-payment">In which countries is Bitcoin accepted as payment?</h2><p><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/in-which-countries-is-bitcoin-accepted-as-payment.png" alt="Bitcoin tokens flying in orbit around Earth" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/in-which-countries-is-bitcoin-accepted-as-payment.png" alt="Bitcoin tokens flying in orbit around Earth" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Due to Bitcoin’s decentralized structure, many users have asked questions such as “where is Bitcoin accepted?” and “is Bitcoin legal?” Here we’ll look at what countries accept Bitcoin and how they treat this currency in terms of regulations.</p><h3>El Salvador</h3><p>El Salvador is the only country where Bitcoin is considered to be legal tender. In June 2021, the El Salvador Congress approved President Nayib Bukele’s proposal to formally adopt Bitcoin as a mode of payment.</p><h3>The United States (U.S.)</h3><p>The U.S. has taken a positive stance toward Bitcoin, though several government agencies have been working to reduce or prevent the use of Bitcoin for illegal transactions. For example, the U.S. Department of Treasury has defined Bitcoin as a money services business (MSB) rather than a currency, placing it under the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank_secrecy_act.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Bank Secrecy Act</a>. According to the act, exchanges and payment processors must adhere to reporting, registration, record keeping, and other similar responsibilities. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also categorized Bitcoin as property for taxation purposes.</p><h3>Canada</h3><p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) considers Bitcoin a commodity, making Bitcoin transactions similar to barter transactions. Therefore, the income generated through Bitcoin transactions is treated as business income. Taxation is contingent on the nature of business — whether it is buying and selling, or is confined to investments.</p><p>Canada views Bitcoin exchanges as money service businesses, bringing them under the purview of the anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Bitcoin exchanges must be registered with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), abide by their compliance plans, keep certain records, and report suspicious transactions. Some major Canadian banks have prohibited the use of their debit and credit cards for Bitcoin transactions.</p><h3>Australia</h3><p>Australia considers Bitcoin as neither money nor foreign currency. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has ruled that it is an asset for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">capital gains tax</a> purposes.</p><h3>The European Union</h3><p>According to the European Court of Justice, buying and selling digital currencies is a supply of services. This exempts crypto from value-added tax (VAT) in all European Union (EU) member states. Additionally, some EU countries have taken their own stance onBitcoin.</p><ul><li aria-level="1">In <strong>Finland</strong>, Bitcoin is considered a commodity, and not a currency.</li><li aria-level="1">In <strong>Belgium</strong>, Bitcoin is exempt from VAT.</li><li aria-level="1">In <strong>Cyprus</strong>, Bitcoin is neither regulated nor controlled.</li><li aria-level="1">In <strong>Bulgaria</strong>, Bitcoin has been brought under the existing tax laws.</li><li aria-level="1">In <strong>Germany</strong>, Bitcoin is regarded as legal but taxed differently based on whether the authorities are dealing with users, miners, enterprises, or exchanges.</li></ul><h2 id="which-countries-banned-bitcoin">Which countries banned Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, which means that it is not created or regulated by any government. That explains why some see it as a potential threat to the existing financial system. Many countries are also hesitant to accept Bitcoin because of its volatility and the possibility that it could be used for money laundering or drug trafficking.</p><p>While some countries have managed to work around these difficulties, others have decided to ban Bitcoin outright. Here are some of the countries that have said a firm “no” to cryptocurrency.</p><h3>China</h3><p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are to all intents and purposes banned in China. The Chinese government has imposed restrictions on miners to prevent the mining of new coins. Financial institutions like banks and payment gateways are also prohibited from transacting in Bitcoin due to its extreme fluctuations in value and also to the authorities’ efforts to prevent money laundering.</p><h3>Russia</h3><p>In Russia, it is illegal to use Bitcoin as payment for goods or services. Dmitry Peskov, the official representative of Vladimir Putin, said that Russia has no reason to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. He argued that putting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on a par with traditional money instruments would only be detrimental to Russia’s financial and economic system, stating “Clearly, Russia is not ready for such moves.”</p><p>However, Bitcoin is not regulated or banned completely — Bitcoin can be mined and stored for the purpose of investment.</p><h3>Vietnam</h3><p>The state bank and government of Vietnam maintain that Bitcoin is not a legal payment method. However, it is not regulated as a mode of investment: suspicion about the immaterial nature of cryptocurrencies remains an obstacle for state-authorized banks that lack control over the crypto ecosystem.</p><h3>Columbia, Bolivia, and Ecuador</h3><p>Columbia does not permit the use or investment of Bitcoin. The central bank of Bolivia has prohibited Bitcoin’s use, along with that of other cryptocurrencies. Ecuador, too, has banned the use of Bitcoin after a majority vote in the national assembly. The ban of crypto in these countries can largely be attributed to government-level concerns about the risks of manipulation and speculation that could have significant impacts on national economies.</p><p>In addition, the high volatility of cryptocurrencies and the lack of knowledge about them have prompted reactive legislative policies in a number of other countries.</p><h2 id="the-rise-of-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency">The rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency</h2><p><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/the-rise-of-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency.png" alt="A person holds in hands a growing Bitcoin token" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/the-rise-of-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency.png" alt="A person holds in hands a growing Bitcoin token" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Ten years ago, cryptocurrencies were largely unknown to the general public. Bitcoin’s first big price increase occurred in 2010 — the value of a single Bitcoin jumped from a fraction of a penny to $0.08. At present, one Bitcoin is worth approximately <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">$41,358</a>. This steady and substantial increase in Bitcoin prices has encouraged more businesses to accept it as a payment method.</p><p>When Bitcoin first started gaining popularity, many countries and businesses voiced their concerns about its legitimacy, value, and potential for growth. Some even banned Bitcoin completely. Contrary to their expectations, Bitcoin has risen to the top of the crypto market and is now considered to be one of the most viable investments. Today, only the countries and companies that didn’t ban crypto are reaping its benefits.</p><h2 id="major-companies-that-accept-bitcoin">Major companies that accept Bitcoin</h2><p>For a customer, the value of any currency depends on where it can be used. If you own Bitcoins and are looking for a way to spend them, here are some of the major international companies that accept this crypto as a form of payment.</p><h3>Overstock</h3><p>Overstock is a leading American online retailer that sells big-ticket items at economical prices by overstocking. It has partnered with Coinbase to enable Bitcoin payments for its online orders. In January 2014, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin as payment. The company generated <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2013/12/21/overstock-com-is-going-to-accept-bitcoin-in-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">over $1 billion in revenue</a> that year.</p><h3>Microsoft</h3><p>Microsoft started accepting Bitcoin in 2014 as payment for apps, games, and other digital content for Xbox and Windows Phone. At one point the company stopped accepting cryptocurrency, but it was quick to resume its service. It also accepts Bitcoin for topping up Microsoft accounts.</p><h3>Wikipedia</h3><p>Wikipedia, the world’s largest open-source encyclopedia, is operated by Wikimedia. Wikimedia accepts donations in Bitcoin, and the transactions are processed through BitPay.</p><h3>Paypal</h3><p>PayPal began accepting Bitcoin in September 2014. PayPal’s move was meant to draw businesses to its platform, rather than attract consumers. The appeal was that Bitcoin’s transaction fee was much lower than the 2%-3% fee charged for credit card transactions. The most obvious benefit for businesses was a widening of the customer base to include those who may not own a credit card but do have Bitcoins to spend.</p><h3>Etsy</h3><p>While Etsy cannot accept Bitcoin across the site, each seller can accept crypto by selecting the “other payment method” option at checkout. When buyers click that option, they can message the seller to say that Bitcoin is their preferred payment method. The seller then provides a Bitcoin address to execute the transaction.</p><p>The Etsy Community forum has a dedicated <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Bitcoin page</a> with tutorials explaining how sellers can advertise their acceptance of Bitcoin.</p><h3>Starbucks</h3><p><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/major-companies-that-accept-bitcoin-starbucks.png" alt="A person paying for coffee using Bitcoin" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img class="" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/major-companies-that-accept-bitcoin-starbucks.png" alt="A person paying for coffee using Bitcoin" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Starbucks joined the Bitcoin revolution in March 2020. Though the company does not accept Bitcoin as an over-the-counter payment for frappuccinos, customers can add Bitcoins — along with frequent-flyer miles and gift card balances — to the Starbucks app and pay via their phones. This upgrade was supported by the Bakkt third-party digital wallet app, which converts Bitcoin to dollars, making Bitcoin payments instantaneous.</p><a class="simple-link-box" href="/work/mobile-solution-for-ordering-coffee-online/"><p>Learn more about ProCoffee, a convenient mobile application for coffee lovers and baristas</p><span></span></a><h3>The Home Depot</h3><p>The Home Depot uses the Winklevoss/Flexa system to accept Bitcoin through its existing digital scanners. Flexa converts Bitcoin to dollars instantaneously, making crypto transactions seamless for both the authorities and the retailer. The buyer can spend their Bitcoins, while The Home Depot gets the dollars in exchange.</p><h3>Rakuten</h3><p>The Japanese cashback and shopping site Rakuten started accepting Bitcoin payments in 2015. They began their global Bitcoin rollout with Rakuten.com in the U.S. and later expanded the new service to its equivalents in Austria and Germany. Rakuten integrated the Bitnet payment processing platform into its marketplaces to accept Bitcoin payments. The company has also developed a Rakuten wallet that supports altcoins like Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. Users can now use their crypto assets to recharge their Rakuten Cash balance.</p><h3>Newegg</h3><p>Newegg, the online electronics giant, accepts Bitcoin as payment. Unlike other platforms, which require you to convert crypto to cash through a third-party service, Newegg lets you make Bitcoin payments directly. Shoppers buying through a computer can conveniently choose the “Pay With Bitcoin” option and proceed to fill in the shipping information as usual. For shoppers making purchases from their phones, Newegg sends a QR code that can be scanned to make payments. Newegg also sells starter-level crypto mining kits for anyone interested in mining Bitcoins independently.</p><h3>Twitch</h3><p>Twitch, the popular streaming video platform, accepts Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, and lesser-used coins like BUSD, GUSD, PAX, XRP, and USDC. Twitch adopted crypto as a payment option in 2014. In 2019, it quietly removed its Bitcoin service, only to bring it back in June 2020.</p><h3>Tesla</h3><p>In February 2021, Tesla purchased a historic $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and started accepting it as payment for automobiles. However, the company went back on its decision three months later due to environmental concerns about the high energy consumption at mining centers. <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1404132183254523905" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Elon Musk’s tweet</a> in June explained Tesla’s future course of action with respect to Bitcoin: “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners, with a positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.”</p><h2 id="bitcoin-and-its-usage-in-various-industries">Bitcoin and its usage in various industries</h2><p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash are the most popular cryptocurrencies, with a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">total market share of 63.88%</a>. As Bitcoin has increased in popularity, more companies have started accepting it. Here are some well-known companies across various industry verticals that have joined the crypto revolution.</p><h3>Jewelry &amp; Watches</h3><p>The jewelry sector is no stranger to Bitcoin payments. These are some of the companies that are happy to receive payments in the form of cryptocurrency:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Etsy</li><li aria-level="1">Kobelli</li><li aria-level="1">Ancora1919</li><li aria-level="1">Fancy</li><li aria-level="1">Saving Pearls</li><li aria-level="1">Domoshop</li><li aria-level="1">Cryptomatic</li></ul><h3>Services &amp; Intermediaries</h3><p>Mobile carriers and television and internet service providers have jumped aboard the Bitcoin train. These are among the providers that offer an option to pay with Bitcoins:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">AT&amp;T</li><li aria-level="1">DISH</li><li aria-level="1">Ynotek</li><li aria-level="1">Bitrefill</li><li aria-level="1">Teahouse Transport</li><li aria-level="1">Purse.io</li><li aria-level="1">eGifter</li><li aria-level="1">Gyft</li></ul><p>An example worth highlighting is <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2019/att_bitpay.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">AT&amp;T</a>, which in 2019 became the first mobile carrier to accept Bitcoin. After logging in online or through the app, customers select BitPay as a payment method. <a href="https://about.dish.com/2018-08-09-DISH-adds-Bitcoin-Cash-as-Option-for-Customers-Migrates-to-BitPay-for-Cryptocurrency-Payment-Processing" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">DISH</a>, a satellite television and internet service provider, started accepting Bitcoin back in 2014, competing directly with AT&amp;T’s satellite service, DirecTV.</p><h3>Food &amp; Beverages</h3><p>You can now use your hard-mined crypto money to bring food to the table. Below are some of the food and beverages businesses that accept Bitcoin payments:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Domino’s Pizza</li><li aria-level="1">Subway</li><li aria-level="1">Burger King</li><li aria-level="1">Whole Foods</li><li aria-level="1">Crypto Coffee</li><li aria-level="1">Wholesale Roots</li><li aria-level="1">Koyah</li><li aria-level="1">Whisky.de</li><li aria-level="1">Lieferando</li><li aria-level="1">The Pembury Tavern</li><li aria-level="1">Undead Coffee</li></ul><p>Key example: <a href="https://ln.pizza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Lightning Pizza</a> accepts Bitcoins as a payment method when ordering Domino’s Pizza online.</p><h3>Banks &amp; Payment services</h3><p>Cryptocurrencies are perceived as a threat to banks because they are faster, safer, and cheaper. Nevertheless, not all banks and payment services are opposed to Bitcoin merchants. We list them below:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Fidor Bank</li><li aria-level="1">Paypal</li><li aria-level="1">Goldman Sachs</li><li aria-level="1">Worldcore</li><li aria-level="1">Bankera</li><li aria-level="1">Royal Bank of Canada</li><li aria-level="1">Intuit</li><li aria-level="1">Vaultoro</li><li aria-level="1">BitcoinCommodities</li><li aria-level="1">Bylls</li><li aria-level="1">Denarium</li></ul><p>Key example: The German <a href="https://www.fidor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Fidor Bank</a> allows customers to buy and sell Bitcoin.</p><p>A number of banks do not permit BTC transactions, either for legal reasons or because it would be tedious to implement and track crypto transactions. Due to the decentralized, unregulated nature of crypto, banks prefer to avoid the prospect of having to resolve Bitcoin-related criminal activities.</p><h3>Online shops</h3><p>Online shopping is more convenient and affordable for consumers, which is why it’s the norm today.

Businesses are starting to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and software and third-party companies are helping accelerate their use. With these additional payment choices, you can spend Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at numerous places across the globe.</p><h3>bitpay</h3><p>Bitpay allows you to use crypto at any merchant that accepts Mastercard. The company also provides a debit card that can be used in conjunction with a crypto wallet. Through Bitpay, users can instantly convert crypto into cash that gets added to the card’s balance. This card acts as a reloadable prepaid debit card that allows customers to use crypto for purchasing items.</p><h3>Flexa</h3><p>Flexa is a payments platform that integrates seamlessly into the user’s existing hardware. Flexa enables businesses to accept up to 25 different coins, tokens, and currencies.</p><h3>Bakkt</h3><p>Bakkt provides Bitcoin futures and options contracts for institutions. It also offers a crypto wallet app for individuals. The Bakkt wallet allows its users to make payments and purchase gift cards with crypto at a number of stores.</p><h3>CoinPayments</h3><p>CoinPayments operates a global payment gateway for individuals to buy crypto and convert it in order to make payments and to purchase gift cards. Its wallet can store over 2,000 cryptocurrencies. CoinPayments also has business accounts, with similar features to Square or PayPal.</p><h3>Cryptobuyer</h3><p>Cryptobuyer allows businesses to accept Bitcoin through its reliable payment portal. The company also offers accounts for individuals looking to secure a crypto wallet or to purchase gift cards using their crypto.</p><h3>BTCPay</h3><p>BTCPay allows businesses to accept Bitcoin. However, BTCPay is a little different from other operators. It is an open-source API solution, allowing companies to set up crypto payments without supplying personal information. Instead of going through a company, a business can connect the API directly to their eCommerce store. Similarly, an individual can integrate BTCPay with their blog to start accepting Bitcoin. BTCPay transactions do not have third-party companies taking fees or collecting data.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>It’s almost impossible to find an industry that Bitcoin hasn’t “touched” yet. While industries such as eCommerce, online media and marketing, software, charity, and gaming have quickly adapted to today’s crypto reality, others — banking, education, and jewelry — are more cautious about cryptocurrencies. This is quite understandable since these industries are generally more conservative and take time to test and experiment with innovations.</p><p>We also see that Western governments are more willing to welcome the novelty of crypto payments than Asian countries. Anyway, Bitcoin has been around for over 10 years and, like other cryptocurrencies, doesn’t seem to stop its invasion of the traditional financial world. There will be even more companies accepting crypto payments and more platforms offering to exchange fiat for crypto and vice versa.</p><p>If you are looking to venture into the blockchain and crypto space and create your own cryptocurrency exchange, our <a id="articleservice" href="https://pixelplex.io/cryptocurrency-exchange-development/">PixelPlex development team</a> is here to help you.

These days, though, performing a monetary transaction is as simple as swiping a card! While most transactions are carried out through government-regulated systems, the world of finance and investment has witnessed the ascent of a new payment method — cryptocurrency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrencies are virtual digital assets that leverage a peer-to-peer system called the blockchain. \u003ca id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/services/blockchain-consulting/\"\u003eBlockchain technology\u003c/a\u003e applies cryptography to create new units and protect each transaction.

Therefore, the income generated through Bitcoin transactions is treated as business income. Taxation is contingent on the nature of business — whether it is buying and selling, or is confined to investments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCanada views Bitcoin exchanges as money service businesses, bringing them under the purview of the anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Bitcoin exchanges must be registered with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), abide by their compliance plans, keep certain records, and report suspicious transactions. Some major Canadian banks have prohibited the use of their debit and credit cards for Bitcoin transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAustralia\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAustralia considers Bitcoin as neither money nor foreign currency.

The central bank of Bolivia has prohibited Bitcoin’s use, along with that of other cryptocurrencies. Ecuador, too, has banned the use of Bitcoin after a majority vote in the national assembly. The ban of crypto in these countries can largely be attributed to government-level concerns about the risks of manipulation and speculation that could have significant impacts on national economies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the high volatility of cryptocurrencies and the lack of knowledge about them have prompted reactive legislative policies in a number of other countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-rise-of-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency\"\u003eThe rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/the-rise-of-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency.png\" alt=\"A person holds in hands a growing Bitcoin token\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen years ago, cryptocurrencies were largely unknown to the general public.

This card acts as a reloadable prepaid debit card that allows customers to use crypto for purchasing items.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFlexa\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlexa is a payments platform that integrates seamlessly into the user\u0026#8217;s existing hardware. Flexa enables businesses to accept up to 25 different coins, tokens, and currencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBakkt\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBakkt provides Bitcoin futures and options contracts for institutions. It also offers a crypto wallet app for individuals. The Bakkt wallet allows its users to make payments and purchase gift cards with crypto at a number of stores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCoinPayments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoinPayments operates a global payment gateway for individuals to buy crypto and convert it in order to make payments and to purchase gift cards. Its wallet can store over 2,000 cryptocurrencies. CoinPayments also has business accounts, with similar features to Square or PayPal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCryptobuyer\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCryptobuyer allows businesses to accept Bitcoin through its reliable payment portal. The company also offers accounts for individuals looking to secure a crypto wallet or to purchase gift cards using their crypto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBTCPay\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBTCPay allows businesses to accept Bitcoin. However, BTCPay is a little different from other operators. It is an open-source API solution, allowing companies to set up crypto payments without supplying personal information. Instead of going through a company, a business can connect the API directly to their eCommerce store. Similarly, an individual can integrate BTCPay with their blog to start accepting Bitcoin. BTCPay transactions do not have third-party companies taking fees or collecting data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s almost impossible to find an industry that Bitcoin hasn\u0026#8217;t “touched” yet. While industries such as eCommerce, online media and marketing, software, charity, and gaming have quickly adapted to today\u0026#8217;s crypto reality, others — banking, education, and jewelry — are more cautious about cryptocurrencies. This is quite understandable since these industries are generally more conservative and take time to test and experiment with innovations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also see that Western governments are more willing to welcome the novelty of crypto payments than Asian countries. Anyway, Bitcoin has been around for over 10 years and, like other cryptocurrencies, doesn’t seem to stop its invasion of the traditional financial world. There will be even more companies accepting crypto payments and more platforms offering to exchange fiat for crypto and vice versa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are looking to venture into the blockchain and crypto space and create your own cryptocurrency exchange, our \u003ca id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/cryptocurrency-exchange-development/\"\u003ePixelPlex development team\u003c/a\u003e is here to help you.
