With the steady flow of new data and continuous update of AI algorithms, doctors have unlimited resources accessible to improve diagnosis and the course of treatment capabilities.</p><p>As the healthcare data in the forms of medical notes, electronic recordings from medical devices, laboratory images, and physical examinations are updated, the AI algorithms learn from newly updated data and improve the accuracy and relevance of their outputs. Several studies have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertreiss/2020/03/03/transforming-drug-discovery-through-artificial-intelligence/#4cc0e8da6a15" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">shown the benefits of AI</a> in the R&amp;D process of developing new drugs as well.</p><p>The various types of AI that help automate these processes are machine learning &amp; deep learning, natural language processing, robotics, robotic process automation, cognition-based automation, and rule-based expert systems.</p><h3 id="machine-learning-and-deep-learning">Machine learning and deep learning</h3><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/machine-learning-and-deep-learning-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="Machine learning examining human body conditions" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/machine-learning-and-deep-learning-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="Machine learning examining human body conditions" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Machine learning makes use of training data to build models of real-world scenarios. Models “learn” from data and produce results without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning is the most implementation of AI technology and the majority of businesses around the world have integrated machine learning into their operations.</p><p>One of the machine learning methods that became popular with the growing number of publicly available datasets is the neural network. Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons capable of modeling complex relations between inputs and outputs.</p><p>With the advancement in computing hardware and mathematical research, scientists recently enhanced neural networks with many interconnecting layers to capture even more complex relations in data and their implications to outputs. This relatively new concept in AI implementation has been identified as deep learning.</p><p>Given the symptoms, genetic makeup, and other medical data as input, deep neural networks are able to precisely predict a person’s likelihood of developing a particular disease. These types of AI models are used in radionics to diagnose patients based on medical images.</p><p>Deep learning algorithms categorize data and extract the clinically relevant features from radiographic images that cannot be so easily perceived by the human eye. MRI and other medical imaging systems used for early cancer detection employ deep learning algorithms to provide a more precise diagnosis, even in unusual cases.</p><p>With the Covid-19 pandemic, machine and deep learning technologies have proved themselves to be of great use.

They are used in healthcare to perform most of the mundane administrative tasks, leaving the human workforce as the supervisor to oversee these processes.</p><h3>Rule-based expert systems</h3><p>Rule-based expert systems provide support for diagnosis or treatment planning at the level of proficiency that an expert doctor would provide. The majority of these systems make use of the set of rules previously modeled by medical experts. Nevertheless, more recent rule-based expert systems may also include probabilistic relations, such as between symptoms and diseases, augmented by causality and temporal relationships as well.</p><h2 id="ai-applications-in-healthcare">Artificial intelligence applications in healthcare</h2><p><a href="https://pixelplex.io/blog/future-ai-applications-benefits-impact-on-business/">Artificial intelligence</a> has a multitude of uses in healthcare. The most successful applications of AI in healthcare are the areas of disease diagnosis, development of treatment protocol, new drug development, and personalized medicine.</p><h3 id="disease-diagnosis-applications">Disease diagnosis applications</h3><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/disease-diagnosis-applications-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="A hand holding a phone that shows conditions of a human body" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/disease-diagnosis-applications-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="A hand holding a phone that shows conditions of a human body" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Disease diagnosis is a challenging and time-consuming process in healthcare. It takes doctors years of medical training to be able to diagnose diseases accurately. While the demand for diagnosis experts keeps rising globally, many healthcare facilities are currently understaffed. This situation puts available doctors under severe strain and often delays life-saving patient diagnostics. Due to these reasons, we are witnessing a growing adoption of AI systems for disease diagnosis.</p><p>Artificial intelligence uses CT scans, electrocardiograms (ECG), cardiac MRI images, skin images, retinal scans, and X-Ray scans to detect cancer, stroke, diabetes, and other diseases. AI algorithms make use of large volumes of high-quality healthcare data to classify or predict diseases with comparable or even better accuracy than human experts.</p><h3 id="treatment-applications">Treatment applications</h3><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/treatment-applications-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="A hand holding a phone with a medical card on the screen" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/treatment-applications-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="A hand holding a phone with a medical card on the screen" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Same as in disease diagnosis, AI is becoming invaluable for the selection of a proper treatment plan. As each patient may respond to a prescribed treatment differently, personalized treatments greatly help patients during the recovery phase.</p><p>Artificial intelligence automates the treatment selection process by making use of genetic and medical data of other patients with similar symptoms to predict the probable response to a prescribed treatment. Although most of the related research is still in the outset, the first batch of real-world tests have had <a href="https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/61246" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">promising results</a>.</p><h3 id="drug-discovery-applications">Drug discovery applications</h3><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/drug-discovery-applications-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="A hand holding a phone with the icon of a microscope on the screen" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/drug-discovery-applications-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="A hand holding a phone with the icon of a microscope on the screen" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Placing a new drug in the market is a complicated process that can last up to 10 years and cost businesses <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/309466/global-r-and-d-expenditure-for-pharmaceuticals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">$200 billion in expenses</a>. The new drugs get stuck between initial trials and regulatory approval. As a result, only 1 out of 10 newly developed drugs ever reach the mass market despite the meticulous drug development R&amp;D process. This state of the pharmaceutical industry is influencing experts to consider new innovative ways to manage workflow.</p><p>Strategies involving AI to assist in the drug development decision-making process are predicted to revolutionize the industry and increase in size up to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1085156/biopharma-ai-market-global-size-by-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">$3 billion</a> by 2025. Artificial intelligence can optimize innovation, improve the efficiency of research and testing, and provide new tools for doctors, patients, insurers, and regulators to meet market demands.</p><p>Every stage of the pharmaceutical R&amp;D process can be improved by AI and lead to increased efficiency:</p><ul><li><strong>Literature survey</strong>. Researchers around the world publish their findings daily in the form of research papers, patents, and other types of gray literature. It is just not possible to collate the information from all of the published documents. Artificial intelligence algorithms can analyze the available literature and extract valuable insights to help researchers make informed decisions early on in the R&amp;D process.</li><li><strong>Identification of principal targets for intervention</strong>. Understanding the biological origin of a disease and its resistance mechanism is the second stage in the development of a new drug. It is essential to identify principal target proteins for disease treatment. Despite the availability of data from different sources, the discovery of viable target pathways remains a great challenge for researchers. This process requires the integration and analysis of all the data to find a relevant pattern which is a perfect task for machine learning algorithms trained for pattern matching. These algorithms analyze the available data and automatically identify the target proteins for intervention.</li><li><strong>Discovery of possible drug candidates</strong>. After the identification of targets, researchers must find the compound that will interact with selected target molecules in the desired way. This process includes scanning millions of candidate compounds and studying their effects and side-effects on the target. Machine learning algorithms can help researchers narrow down the selection to the best drug candidates, as they are able to rapidly synthesize the information about the so-called structure fingerprints and molecular descriptors to predict the suitability of a candidate molecule.</li><li><strong>Clinical trials</strong>. The success of a clinical trial depends on the accurate selection of suitable candidates. The selection of wrong candidates can prolong the clinical trials and increase the cost of the drug discovery process. Artificial intelligence can help the researchers identify suitable candidates for clinical trials. Machine learning makes use of data to ensure the proper distribution for groups of participants. At this stage of a new drug development, AI algorithms monitor &amp; predict trial cost, enrollment, and quality. They can also serve as an early warning system for a clinical trial that is not producing conclusive and/or expected results.</li><li><strong>Selection of biomarkers for disease diagnosis</strong>. It is possible to identify the disease either by genome sequencing or by utilizing the biological markers. Genome sequencing is a method that involves expensive lab equipment as well as expert knowledge. On the other hand, the biomarker approach is more economical and reliable. At the same time, their discovery is challenging and involves a lot of manual work. Artificial intelligence algorithms help automate the identification of suitable candidate biomarkers, which in turn, increase the prospects of success and decrease the expenses.</li></ul><h3 id="personalized-medicine-applications">Personalized medicine applications</h3><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/personalized-medicine-applications-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="A hand holding a phone with icons of people and drugs on the screen" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/personalized-medicine-applications-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="A hand holding a phone with icons of people and drugs on the screen" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Another use case of AI in healthcare is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-intelai/2019/02/11/how-machine-learning-is-crafting-precision-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">precision medicine</a>, a drug or treatment designed especially for an individual or a small group of people.

The most prominent challenges that AI is facing in its adoption are related to the AI-caused errors, availability of quality data for model training, and patient privacy.</p><h3 id="errors-and-injuries">Errors and injuries</h3><p>Artificial intelligence algorithms trained using low quality, incomplete or biased data will produce erroneous results. The biggest challenge with AI caused mistakes in healthcare is accountability, who is responsible for the error.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200512134541.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">recent study</a> has shown that, despite its potential to revolutionize modern medicine, AI-based medical imaging has serious shortcomings. AI algorithms used for medical image reconstruction result in unwanted alterations in data in the final images. These effects were not typically present in non-AI based imaging techniques.</p><p>Even though medical errors occur in all healthcare systems, AI-caused errors are different for two reasons. First, patients and healthcare providers will react differently to injuries and suffering resulting from software than humans, seeking accountability. Second, the mistakes made by the AI system will have a large scale impact due to their widespread use, while human errors usually are localized affecting a limited number of patients.</p><h3 id="quality-of-data">Quality of data</h3><p>AI algorithms require a large volume of data for training. The available data often must be obtained from multiple different systems and sources in various formats. The collection process is expensive, increases the risk of having errors, and decreases the comprehensiveness of the dataset.</p><p>Healthcare data may often be of low quality, subjective, and inaccurate. For example, electronic medical records are unstructured, patients may give false information, or data is incomplete due to privacy reasons.</p><p>Machine learning algorithms used in healthcare systems are prone to algorithmic bias as well, sometimes predicting the higher likelihood of a disease based on gender or race when it may not be causal.</p><p>For example, if the training data comes from academic medical centers, the machine learning algorithms will “know” less about, and therefore may establish a wrong diagnosis for patients that do not have access to academic medical centers. Similarly, when using speech-recognition AI to obtain the patient visit notes, algorithms may perform worse when patients belong to a gender or race that is underrepresented in the training data.</p><h3 id="patient-privacy">Patient privacy</h3><p>Another challenge associated with AI in healthcare is related to privacy. The collection of data for training of AI algorithms can violate patient privacy. Already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/technology/google-university-chicago-data-sharing-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">law-suits</a> are being initiated due to the data-sharing between large healthcare providers and AI-companies. The privacy problem associated with AI algorithms goes further as these can predict a patient’s private information without it explicitly given in the data.</p><p>Due to the seriousness of the privacy issue, some solutions have emerged, namely, to assemble high-quality datasets while protecting patient privacy, governments should be involved in providing the infrastructure. This infrastructure could range from setting standards for electronic health records to directly providing technical support for high-quality data-gathering efforts in health systems. The second approach to the solution is a direct investment in the creation of high-quality datasets. Two initiatives,  <a href="https://allofus.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">All of Us </a>and <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">BioBank</a>, have already developed plans to collect comprehensive healthcare data while facilitating the trust and participation of the patients.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-ai-in-healthcare">The future of AI in healthcare</h2><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/the-future-of-ai-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="Cooperation of two health workers and a robot on checking data" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/the-future-of-ai-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="Cooperation of two health workers and a robot on checking data" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>As the paradigm shifts universally to conveying health from illness management to wellness maintenance, AI will play a very significant role in the personalization of healthcare. The availability of high-quality and comprehensive data will be an essential factor for the future success of AI in healthcare.</p><p>IoT-enabled patient monitoring, asset tracking, and inventory management systems will provide invaluable data as input to AI algorithms to improve the health of patients, working conditions of health workers, and healthcare system operational efficiency.</p><p>As the AI algorithms continue to get better at their tasks, the robots used in healthcare will become more prominent. Robots will assist and collaborate with humans to handle time- and energy-consuming tasks and help prevent operational errors.</p><p>Patient privacy concerns are receding with the development of large scale AI systems for healthcare. In the future, blockchain technology will be combined with AI to mitigate privacy concerns and establish a <a href="https://pixelplex.io/blog/blockchain-and-iot-for-pharma-supply-chains/">more secure and transparent healthcare system</a>.</p><p>Artificial intelligence will enable doctors to access a large number of diagnostic resources on web databases and find the desired research study or clinical report faster and more efficiently.</p><p>Despite common fears that AI may eventually replace or reduce the need for human doctors, recent studies have shown that AI will more likely benefit and enhance clinical diagnostics and decision-making processes than reduce the need for physicians. The synergy between artificial intelligence and human intelligence promises a bright future for the healthcare system.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Artificial intelligence is becoming an integral tool in healthcare. The most promising applications of AI are effective decision-making and processing of complex medical data. For example, AI benefits the doctors by providing a quantitative and qualitative assessment of patients that have multiple symptoms correlating with various genetic and physical conditions. In such cases, AI improves the accuracy of early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome prediction.</p><p>As machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning, and robotics technologies progress many new applications of AI in healthcare will emerge.

Already \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/technology/google-university-chicago-data-sharing-lawsuit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"\u003elaw-suits\u003c/a\u003e are being initiated due to the data-sharing between large healthcare providers and AI-companies. The privacy problem associated with AI algorithms goes further as these can predict a patient\u0026#8217;s private information without it explicitly given in the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the seriousness of the privacy issue, some solutions have emerged, namely, to assemble high-quality datasets while protecting patient privacy, governments should be involved in providing the infrastructure. This infrastructure could range from setting standards for electronic health records to directly providing technical support for high-quality data-gathering efforts in health systems. The second approach to the solution is a direct investment in the creation of high-quality datasets. Two initiatives,  \u003ca href=\"https://allofus.nih.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eAll of Us \u003c/a\u003eand \u003ca href=\"https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eBioBank\u003c/a\u003e, have already developed plans to collect comprehensive healthcare data while facilitating the trust and participation of the patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-future-of-ai-in-healthcare\"\u003eThe future of AI in healthcare\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/the-future-of-ai-in-healthcare.jpg\" alt=\"Cooperation of two health workers and a robot on checking data\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the paradigm shifts universally to conveying health from illness management to wellness maintenance, AI will play a very significant role in the personalization of healthcare. The availability of high-quality and comprehensive data will be an essential factor for the future success of AI in healthcare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIoT-enabled patient monitoring, asset tracking, and inventory management systems will provide invaluable data as input to AI algorithms to improve the health of patients, working conditions of health workers, and healthcare system operational efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the AI algorithms continue to get better at their tasks, the robots used in healthcare will become more prominent. Robots will assist and collaborate with humans to handle time- and energy-consuming tasks and help prevent operational errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatient privacy concerns are receding with the development of large scale AI systems for healthcare. In the future, blockchain technology will be combined with AI to mitigate privacy concerns and establish a \u003ca href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/blockchain-and-iot-for-pharma-supply-chains/\"\u003emore secure and transparent healthcare system\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArtificial intelligence will enable doctors to access a large number of diagnostic resources on web databases and find the desired research study or clinical report faster and more efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite common fears that AI may eventually replace or reduce the need for human doctors, recent studies have shown that AI will more likely benefit and enhance clinical diagnostics and decision-making processes than reduce the need for physicians. The synergy between artificial intelligence and human intelligence promises a bright future for the healthcare system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArtificial intelligence is becoming an integral tool in healthcare. The most promising applications of AI are effective decision-making and processing of complex medical data. For example, AI benefits the doctors by providing a quantitative and qualitative assessment of patients that have multiple symptoms correlating with various genetic and physical conditions. In such cases, AI improves the accuracy of early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome prediction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning, and robotics technologies progress many new applications of AI in healthcare will emerge.
