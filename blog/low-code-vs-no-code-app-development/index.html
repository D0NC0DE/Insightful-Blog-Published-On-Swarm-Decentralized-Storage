But which option is better and what criteria do you have to consider beforehand?</p><p id="introduction">If you haven’t heard anything about low- and no-code app development platforms, it’s definitely time to catch up. The automation of software development has brought about numerous rapid application development (RAD) tools and platforms that have the capacity to completely upend the entire process, make it considerably faster, and, crucially, put some development-like capabilities into the hands of business users who have little or no at all technical background.</p><p>Both low-code and no-code development platforms offer an opportunity to develop software applications without having extensive knowledge of traditional programming languages. Instead, they rely on special visual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">integrated development environments</a> (IDE) that empower users to design apps by simply dragging and dropping the necessary components. As a result, they significantly reduce development time and increase overall efficiency.</p><p>The concept of low-code/no-code development was introduced back in 2014, though its roots go back to the 1990s. These days, low- and no-code platforms are taking the software industry by storm, shortening the learning curve and reshaping traditional software development.</p><p>Sounds like fun, right? So, let’s continue exploring further to gain more insights about low-code and no-code development platforms, the differences between them, their benefits and limitations, and find out which option will fit your organization best.</p><h2 id="lowdown-on-low-code-platforms">Lowdown on low-code platforms</h2><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lowdown-on-low-code-platforms.png" alt="People developing software using a low-code platform" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lowdown-on-low-code-platforms.png" alt="People developing software using a low-code platform" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Low-code is a unique software development approach that allows you to deliver applications much faster and with minimal hand coding. A low-code app development platform is essentially a set of tools that allow for the visual development of applications via modeling and a graphical user interface.</p><p>With the minimum amount of hand coding, low-code permits users to quickly and seamlessly create solid apps with captivating UI, modern integrations, and understandable logic. Besides, it’s been estimated that the global low-code development market is expected to hit <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5184624/low-code-development-platform-market-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">$187 billion by 2030</a>.</p><p>Naturally, low-code development platforms are considered a good match for creating business process management apps that can be integrated with other apps, systems, and databases. Low-code enables non-professionals to join the development team and make their own contribution to the common project. Similarly, it enables even experienced developers to spend less time on app development than they would in a standard software project.</p><p>Using low-code builders gives organizations the chance to enhance their agility and streamline productivity. Low-code also offers end-to-end digitalization, which means that such a platform can be used throughout the entire application development cycle — from handling and organizing all business data and creating the app architecture to testing, development, and deployment management.</p><h3>What can you build with low-code platforms?</h3><p>Low-code development platforms are regarded as a perfect fit for building apps that deal with customer engagement, operational efficiency, and legacy migration.</p><h4>Customer engagement apps</h4><p>With the help of customer engagement applications, customers and partners can interact easily and efficiently with the organization. These apps are tremendously important for enhancing customer satisfaction and retention and generating bigger revenue. The most relevant examples of this kind of app are agent/broker and customer portals, claims management apps, special student service apps, self-service policy administration apps, and the like.</p><p>Considering that a lot of enterprises don’t have sufficient UX resources, low-code app development platforms have the advantage of offering an incorporated UI framework with numerous handy widgets and building blocks that aim to simplify the development of multi-channel apps for users without any UX background.</p><h4>Operational efficiency apps</h4><p>The main objective of operational efficiency apps (OEA) is to reduce costs by automating complicated and tiresome manual and/or paper-based processes. These apps are designed to support and optimize departmental, cross-departmental and organization-wide processes, and can be seamlessly integrated into the business’ core system. Some examples of operational efficiency applications are supply chain management, claims and invoice processing, university registration, and order management apps.</p><p>By applying well-designed and easy-to-use low-code platforms, organizations can facilitate the development of advanced operational efficiency applications and considerably simplify their processes.</p><a class="simple-link-box" href="/doc-flow/"><p>Looking for an ideal document management system? Check out DocFlow</p><span></span></a><h4>Legacy migration apps</h4><p>Legacy migration applications are used to replace legacy applications that are unable to maintain new processes or offer the required user experience. Examples include legacy app migrations of Microsoft Access, Sharepoint, and Excel to updated systems.</p><p>When dealing with legacy migration, low-code can provide novel functionality and bring the overall UX to a whole new level. Low-code platforms also back up modern microservice architectures and make use of built-in capabilities that are good at tackling quality and maintainability issues at each development stage.</p><h2 id="getting-to-grips-with-no-code-platforms">Getting to grips with no-code platforms</h2><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/getting-to-grips-with-no-code-platforms.png" alt="People building software using a no-code platform" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/getting-to-grips-with-no-code-platforms.png" alt="People building software using a no-code platform" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>The introduction of no-code application development platforms marks a new era in the technological landscape. By using no-code builders, businesses, as well as individuals without coding skills, are capable of creating apps with the help of ready-made UI templates and a bunch of drag-and-drop features. No-code will exempt you from creating frameworks and connecting databases and will eliminate the need to deal with other laborious tasks that are inherent to hard coding. Thus, the app development process is tremendously simplified and users without a coding background (and even without a magic wand!) are able to develop apps themselves.</p><h3>Who can make the most of no-code platforms?</h3><p>No-code apps open up new horizons in terms of digital capabilities for a wide range of entities and individuals, including small businesses, sales and marketing teams, enterprises, consultants, and freelancers. They allow anyone to seize the chance to become a citizen developer and embark on developing business applications. Team members are also encouraged to design the applications that they themselves consider to be essential to fill gaps in numerous processes. No-code can be put to good use in a variety of business areas, including accounting and finance, HR and administration, marketing and sales.</p><h4>Accounting and finance</h4><p>Those who are engaged in the sphere of finance and accounting will find no-code applications extremely useful and convenient. The applications built on no-code platforms can be used in activities such as automatic reporting, profit and expense analysis, investment tracking, accounts receivable collection, payroll and invoice reporting — and that list is far from complete.</p><h4>HR and administration</h4><p>No-code provides an excellent opportunity to make HR automation more efficient and cheaper. The applications created on no-code platforms have a bunch of outstanding features such as relative ease-of-use and rapid deployment, and can significantly optimize employee onboarding along with performance reviews.</p><h4>Marketing and sales</h4><p>By using no-code applications, marketing teams can bolster their campaign creation and distribution. As a result, processes will run faster, more smoothly, and in a much more organized way. As well as this, no-code apps help process data for in-depth content, which can bring about even more valuable marketing and sales assets.</p><h2 id="understanding-the-difference-between-low-code-and-no-code">Understanding the difference between low-code and no-code</h2><p>The line between low-code and no-code is not that sharp. The clue is in the names. Despite the fact that a low-code development platform involves only minimum coding requirements, it isn’t necessarily free from hard coding altogether. No-code development, though, can be mastered by anyone.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that though both options hinge on the idea of utilizing the benefits of visual modeling, there’s a significant difference in the scale and types of app that can be delivered via these approaches. So, no-code development tools can work well for businesses that are eager to solve simple functional use cases and design unsophisticated apps that will be used by a particular department within the organization. Moreover, apps that have been created on no-code platforms don’t have huge scalability or integration capabilities. In the long run, this can lead to issues with architectural considerations, extensibility, and governance.</p><p>On the other hand, low-code platforms are generally more scalable and flexible when it comes to cloud and/or on-premises deployment. They are also perfectly capable of extending their platform capabilities via open APIs intended for reusability. Compared to no-code, low-code platforms are suitable for creating more sophisticated apps and are able to address a larger number of use cases thanks to their general-purpose nature. What’s more, a number of low-code platforms can be integrated with third-party smart services such as AI, machine learning, IoT, voice and facial recognition services, and some other tools provided by the open source community.</p><a class="simple-link-box" href="/work/loyalty-platform-for-football-club-owners/"><p>Take a look at this web &amp; mobile IoT-powered solution for BMW dealer showroom services</p><span></span></a><h2 id="key-features-to-consider-when-comparing-the platforms">Key features to consider when comparing the platforms</h2><p>To make it easier to distinguish between low- and no-code platforms, let’s focus on the main criteria represented in the table below.</p><div class="table-wrapper-default"><table style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;height:173px"><tbody><tr style="height:24px"><td style="height:24px;width:34%"></td><td style="height:24px;width:33%">Low-code</td><td style="height:24px;width:33%">No-code</td></tr><tr style="height:48px"><td>Visual integrated development environment</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">+</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">+</td></tr><tr style="height:48px"><td>Seamless integration with other services</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">+</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">–</td></tr><tr style="height:48px"><td>Suitable for business applications</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">+</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">+</td></tr><tr style="height:48px"><td>Suitable for consumer applications</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">+</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">–</td></tr><tr style="height:48px"><td>Special training required</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">+</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">–</td></tr><tr style="height:48px"><td>Budget needed</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">High</td><td style="height:48px;width:33%;text-align:center">Low</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>Visual integrated development environment (IDE)</h4><p>Both low-code and no-code application development platforms are based on the visual IDE, and most of them use model-driven development (MDD) which helps them determine the app’s behavior, the processing logic that stands behind it, and so on.</p><h4>Seamless integration with other services</h4><p>Sometimes, you may need to gather data from different systems by integrating your app with other services. Low-code platforms provide ample opportunities for integration with various third-party services, whereas no-code, it has to be said, lags behind in this area.</p><h4>Suitable for business applications</h4><p>Whenever you wish to develop an app specifically for your organization, you can opt for either platform. But it’s important to bear in mind that with low-code you can still build highly elaborate apps which can help you handle complicated and demanding business processes. No-code, though, is great for creating applications that major in solving simple, not too thorny, business issues.</p><h4>Suitable for consumer applications</h4><p>No-code is not the best option to follow when developing applications for very demanding consumers, as it can involve some serious security and compliance risks. Low-code, for its part, is suitable for dealing with complicated apps that are capable of handling just about anything.</p><h4>Special training</h4><p>To get started with no-code, you don’t need to have technical knowledge, whereas, with low-code, you’re still required to have or obtain at least a basic understanding of hard coding, as these platforms normally involve more complex customization and development techniques.</p><h4>Budget needed</h4><p>Although both of the options aim to decrease development costs, there are differences in their pricing. Designing more sophisticated apps with low-code will be more costly compared to basic apps created via no-code platforms.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-low-code-no-code-development">What are the risks of low-code/no-code development?</h2><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/what-are-the-risks-of-low-code-no-code-development.jpg" alt="A person examining risks of no-code and low-code development" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/what-are-the-risks-of-low-code-no-code-development.jpg" alt="A person examining risks of no-code and low-code development" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Even if low-code and/or no-code seems to be exactly what you’ve been looking for, you’re still advised not to rush, and to consider some of the challenges you may stumble upon during the development process:</p><h3>Relatively limited flexibility</h3><p>When using traditional code, developers are empowered to customize the software to literally any degree they are required to, while both low- and no-code are reliant on the ready-made functionality of the platforms and their plugins. If a particular functionality hasn’t been implemented, the development team may struggle to fulfill the requirements. That’s why you’re advised to acquaint yourself with all the platform’s functionalities and opportunities in advance so as to avoid unpleasant surprises during the deployment stage.</p><h3>Security risks</h3><p>The thing that you should always bear in mind when opting for low- or no-code platforms is that both of them heavily rely on their providers — as a result, due to the lack of control over the source code, you can face security issues. Moreover, if the platform provider is liquidated, you’ll end up without any security updates and you’ll have to bear the burden and fix all the issues yourself. Plus, you can also run the risk of security breaches if the low-/no-code platform provider acts as its host and doesn’t seem to be sufficiently reliable.</p><h3>Hidden costs</h3><p>It’s advisable not to be lured in by the upfront savings that low- or no-code development offers, as what initially seems to be a cheaper approach can come at a price in the long run. Product quality shouldn’t wither away once you’re focused on reducing operational costs — otherwise, a nickel-and-dime attitude won’t bring the desired result.</p><p>However, this consideration doesn’t diminish the reputation of low-code and no-code platforms — it’s simply a reminder that you have to be ready for increased testing if you want to deliver a reliable, high-quality product. Citizen developers who normally stand behind this type of development lack testing experience and consequently need additional assistance to make sure that their apps are user-friendly, totally secure, and properly functioning.</p><a class="simple-link-box" href="/blog/how-to-create-mobile-apps/"><p>We at PixelPlex know what it takes to create a robust mobile app. Check out our detailed guide</p><span></span></a><h2 id="overview-of-low-code-application-development-platforms">Overview of low-code application development platforms</h2><p>As of today, there’s a variety of low-code platforms to choose from, and each comes with its own set of modern and convenient features.

BuildFire comes with multiple options for monetization and possesses a well-thought-out dashboard that considerably eases the development process.</p><h2 id="and-finally">And finally</h2><p>Being user-friendly, reasonably priced, and feature-rich, both low- and no-code options look very promising and are set to continue reshaping business IT, making it possible for anyone to join the development process. Still, before venturing into either app builder, you’re advised to exhaustively examine the specifics and requirements of your business, think of the customization and integration capabilities of the different platforms, and decide what functions you want your application-to-be to perform.</p><p>However, we’ve been so engrossed in low- and no-code that we seem to have forgotten about good old traditional custom development. Not good on our part, really… Let’s address this mess-up straight away!</p><p>If you’re set to build a fully-fledged, robust, and secure solution that will expand the capacity of your freshly-formed business, then it’s more advisable to set your sights on custom development and turn to a <a id="articleservice" href="https://pixelplex.io/mobile-app-development/">professional team of developers</a> who will deliver complex yet unique and multi-functional applications. They will tailor a digital solution that will comply with all your requirements and, crucially, draft an all-encompassing roadmap, where they’ll pinpoint the key aspects and minutiae of the entire project.</p><p>In addition, don’t lose sight of the fact that both of the contrasting approaches — low-/no-code and custom development — can be used in tandem to drive speed and innovation. Probably, we’ve yet to see how low-code and no-code development will become an essential part of the entire software ecosystem and help boost productivity, engender more sophisticated solutions, and foster collaboration.</p></article><div class="block-right"><p>Newsletter</p><span>Subscribe to our newsletter to receive the latest news about technologies, enterprise solutions, tools, frameworks, and more.</span><form><input name="email" placeholder="Email address"/><button type="submit" aria-label="Submit"></button></form><a></a></div></div><div class="author-container-bottom"><div class="author-container-inner"><img width="48px" height="48px" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/k.belova-2.jpg" alt="author" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img width="48px" height="48px" src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/k.belova-2.jpg" alt="author" loading="lazy"/></noscript><div><p>Kira Belova</p><p>Copywriter</p></div></div></div><div class="social-networks-bt"><p>Follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pixelplex.inc" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pixelplex-inc" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>  to keep abreast of our latest news and articles.

The automation of software development has brought about numerous rapid application development (RAD) tools and platforms that have the capacity to completely upend the entire process, make it considerably faster, and, crucially, put some development-like capabilities into the hands of business users who have little or no at all technical background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth low-code and no-code development platforms offer an opportunity to develop software applications without having extensive knowledge of traditional programming languages. Instead, they rely on special visual \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"\u003eintegrated development environments\u003c/a\u003e (IDE) that empower users to design apps by simply dragging and dropping the necessary components. As a result, they significantly reduce development time and increase overall efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concept of low-code/no-code development was introduced back in 2014, though its roots go back to the 1990s. These days, low- and no-code platforms are taking the software industry by storm, shortening the learning curve and reshaping traditional software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds like fun, right? So, let’s continue exploring further to gain more insights about low-code and no-code development platforms, the differences between them, their benefits and limitations, and find out which option will fit your organization best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"lowdown-on-low-code-platforms\"\u003eLowdown on low-code platforms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lowdown-on-low-code-platforms.png\" alt=\"People developing software using a low-code platform\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLow-code is a unique software development approach that allows you to deliver applications much faster and with minimal hand coding. A low-code app development platform is essentially a set of tools that allow for the visual development of applications via modeling and a graphical user interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the minimum amount of hand coding, low-code permits users to quickly and seamlessly create solid apps with captivating UI, modern integrations, and understandable logic. Besides, it’s been estimated that the global low-code development market is expected to hit \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5184624/low-code-development-platform-market-research\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"\u003e$187 billion by 2030\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, low-code development platforms are considered a good match for creating business process management apps that can be integrated with other apps, systems, and databases. Low-code enables non-professionals to join the development team and make their own contribution to the common project. Similarly, it enables even experienced developers to spend less time on app development than they would in a standard software project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing low-code builders gives organizations the chance to enhance their agility and streamline productivity. Low-code also offers end-to-end digitalization, which means that such a platform can be used throughout the entire application development cycle — from handling and organizing all business data and creating the app architecture to testing, development, and deployment management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat can you build with low-code platforms?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLow-code development platforms are regarded as a perfect fit for building apps that deal with customer engagement, operational efficiency, and legacy migration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCustomer engagement apps\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the help of customer engagement applications, customers and partners can interact easily and efficiently with the organization. These apps are tremendously important for enhancing customer satisfaction and retention and generating bigger revenue. The most relevant examples of this kind of app are agent/broker and customer portals, claims management apps, special student service apps, self-service policy administration apps, and the like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering that a lot of enterprises don’t have sufficient UX resources, low-code app development platforms have the advantage of offering an incorporated UI framework with numerous handy widgets and building blocks that aim to simplify the development of multi-channel apps for users without any UX background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOperational efficiency apps\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main objective of operational efficiency apps (OEA) is to reduce costs by automating complicated and tiresome manual and/or paper-based processes.

By using no-code builders, businesses, as well as individuals without coding skills, are capable of creating apps with the help of ready-made UI templates and a bunch of drag-and-drop features. No-code will exempt you from creating frameworks and connecting databases and will eliminate the need to deal with other laborious tasks that are inherent to hard coding. Thus, the app development process is tremendously simplified and users without a coding background (and even without a magic wand!) are able to develop apps themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWho can make the most of no-code platforms?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo-code apps open up new horizons in terms of digital capabilities for a wide range of entities and individuals, including small businesses, sales and marketing teams, enterprises, consultants, and freelancers. They allow anyone to seize the chance to become a citizen developer and embark on developing business applications. Team members are also encouraged to design the applications that they themselves consider to be essential to fill gaps in numerous processes. No-code can be put to good use in a variety of business areas, including accounting and finance, HR and administration, marketing and sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eAccounting and finance\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who are engaged in the sphere of finance and accounting will find no-code applications extremely useful and convenient. The applications built on no-code platforms can be used in activities such as automatic reporting, profit and expense analysis, investment tracking, accounts receivable collection, payroll and invoice reporting — and that list is far from complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHR and administration\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo-code provides an excellent opportunity to make HR automation more efficient and cheaper.

As a result, processes will run faster, more smoothly, and in a much more organized way. As well as this, no-code apps help process data for in-depth content, which can bring about even more valuable marketing and sales assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"understanding-the-difference-between-low-code-and-no-code\"\u003eUnderstanding the difference between low-code and no-code\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line between low-code and no-code is not that sharp. The clue is in the names. Despite the fact that a low-code development platform involves only minimum coding requirements, it isn’t necessarily free from hard coding altogether. No-code development, though, can be mastered by anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also worth noting that though both options hinge on the idea of utilizing the benefits of visual modeling, there’s a significant difference in the scale and types of app that can be delivered via these approaches. So, no-code development tools can work well for businesses that are eager to solve simple functional use cases and design unsophisticated apps that will be used by a particular department within the organization. Moreover, apps that have been created on no-code platforms don’t have huge scalability or integration capabilities. In the long run, this can lead to issues with architectural considerations, extensibility, and governance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, low-code platforms are generally more scalable and flexible when it comes to cloud and/or on-premises deployment. They are also perfectly capable of extending their platform capabilities via open APIs intended for reusability. Compared to no-code, low-code platforms are suitable for creating more sophisticated apps and are able to address a larger number of use cases thanks to their general-purpose nature. What’s more, a number of low-code platforms can be integrated with third-party smart services such as AI, machine learning, IoT, voice and facial recognition services, and some other tools provided by the open source community.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Take a look at this web \u0026 mobile IoT-powered solution for BMW dealer showroom services","url":"https://pixelplex.io/work/loyalty-platform-for-football-club-owners/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"\u003ch2 id=\"key-features-to-consider-when-comparing-the platforms\"\u003eKey features to consider when comparing the platforms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make it easier to distinguish between low- and no-code platforms, let’s focus on the main criteria represented in the table below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"table-wrapper-default\"\u003e\n\u003ctable style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 173px;\"\u003e\n\u003ctbody\u003e\n\u003ctr style=\"height: 24px;\"\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 24px; width: 34%;\"\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 24px; width: 33%;\"\u003eLow-code\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 24px; width: 33%;\"\u003eNo-code\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr style=\"height: 48px;\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eVisual integrated development environment\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003e+\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003e+\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr style=\"height: 48px;\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eSeamless integration with other services\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003e+\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u0026#8211;\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr style=\"height: 48px;\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eSuitable for business applications\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003e+\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003e+\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr style=\"height: 48px;\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eSuitable for consumer applications\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003e+\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u0026#8211;\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr style=\"height: 48px;\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eSpecial training required\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003e+\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u0026#8211;\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr style=\"height: 48px;\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eBudget needed\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003eHigh\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"height: 48px; width: 33%; text-align: center;\"\u003eLow\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eVisual integrated development environment (IDE)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth low-code and no-code application development platforms are based on the visual IDE, and most of them use model-driven development (MDD) which helps them determine the app’s behavior, the processing logic that stands behind it, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSeamless integration with other services\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, you may need to gather data from different systems by integrating your app with other services.

If a particular functionality hasn’t been implemented, the development team may struggle to fulfill the requirements. That’s why you’re advised to acquaint yourself with all the platform\u0026#8217;s functionalities and opportunities in advance so as to avoid unpleasant surprises during the deployment stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSecurity risks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing that you should always bear in mind when opting for low- or no-code platforms is that both of them heavily rely on their providers — as a result, due to the lack of control over the source code, you can face security issues. Moreover, if the platform provider is liquidated, you’ll end up without any security updates and you’ll have to bear the burden and fix all the issues yourself. Plus, you can also run the risk of security breaches if the low-/no-code platform provider acts as its host and doesn’t seem to be sufficiently reliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHidden costs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s advisable not to be lured in by the upfront savings that low- or no-code development offers, as what initially seems to be a cheaper approach can come at a price in the long run. Product quality shouldn’t wither away once you’re focused on reducing operational costs — otherwise, a nickel-and-dime attitude won’t bring the desired result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this consideration doesn’t diminish the reputation of low-code and no-code platforms — it’s simply a reminder that you have to be ready for increased testing if you want to deliver a reliable, high-quality product.
