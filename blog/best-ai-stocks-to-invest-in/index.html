Here’s how we can classify companies that have launched their AI projects according to investment considerations.</p><h3>Research (university) spin-offs</h3><p>Research/University spin-offs are newly formed companies that transform research efforts into technological inventions and, eventually, profitable business models. These companies are research-oriented and tackle difficult problems. Research spin-off teams are composed of experienced innovators capable of delivering breakthroughs that advance the field. However, investing in research spin-offs is a long shot, as they are less likely to bring quick returns due to the nature of scientific research.</p><h3>Data-as-a-service companies</h3><p>Data-as-a-service (DaaS) companies gather specialized datasets or create new data sources by connecting previously unrelated vertical markets. These companies are usually highly profitable and not easily replicable.</p><h3>Model-as-a-service companies</h3><p>Model-as-a-Service companies are one of the most widespread groups, creating streams of revenue by commercializing their models. These companies offer viable products early on and have a high potential to monetize their products in the short term, but their technology needs to be further developed to extract real value. These companies usually come in three forms: narrow AI, value extractors, and enablers.</p><p>Narrow AI are companies that focus on solving a specific problem through new data, innovative algorithms, or better interfaces. Their products could be used and distributed as part of a bigger solution or a platform.</p><p>Value extractors are companies that utilize their models to extract value and insights from data. Their solutions can be either integrated into customer solutions through APIs or be delivered as full-stacks solutions.</p><p>Enabler companies enable the final users to do their analysis, allow them to make daily workflows more efficient, or unlock new opportunities by creating new applications.</p><h3>Robot-as-a-service companies</h3><p>Robot-as-a-Service companies create virtual or physical agents that people interact with. Virtual agents, most commonly chatbots, are low cost, easily accessible systems. Physical agents, on the other hand, are autonomous cars, drones, and industrial robots that employ AI in executing their tasks. Physical robot manufacturing companies require high capital and talented employees.</p><p>This group of companies usually faces problems due to hardware components becoming quickly obsolete and the difficulties in creating the right interactive interfaces. However, successful companies from this group are a great prospect for generating long-term profits from investment.</p><h2 id="what-you-should-consider-when-investing-in-ai-stocks">What you should consider when investing in AI stocks</h2><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/what-you-should-consider-when-investing-in-ai-stocks.jpg" alt="Two people wearing suits next to a pile of coins and a direction sign" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/what-you-should-consider-when-investing-in-ai-stocks.jpg" alt="Two people wearing suits next to a pile of coins and a direction sign" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Investing in artificial intelligence projects is very attractive as the technology has established itself in many industries and dominates the way business is done in the majority of large enterprises. Due to the technological versatility of AI, it is not being used just by software companies but also by retail companies, financial organizations, healthcare providers, educational institutions, and supply chain companies. One of the primary ways of investing is by purchasing stocks of these companies and organizations. Below are some essential factors to consider before trying to capitalize on AI projects.</p><h3>Associated risks</h3><p>Data is the principal input for artificial intelligence algorithms. In some applications, collecting and utilizing data to train machine learning models may involve privacy concerns. A known example of a company struggling with this issue is DeepMind. In 2016, the company agreed to gain access to health data from the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, which operates three London hospitals with around 1.6 million annual patients. This agreement led to <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2017/07/royal-free-google-deepmind-trial-failed-to-comply-with-data-protection-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">a legal battle</a> as it was against the Data Protection Act. These kinds of disputes may tarnish the brand’s identity and lead to significant losses for the investors as well.</p><p>The autonomous car industry entails ethical concerns from state regulatory bodies and institutions. Due to possible changes in these regulations and the complications related to maintaining compliance, investment in driverless car companies can be risky. Thorough research is necessary to understand the complex ethical dynamics of this industry.</p><p>Substantial risks are associated with investments in AI companies that are solving a broad scope of business problems. It is safer to invest in companies that limit their services to a specific market or target a specific type of client. Such companies have better chances of succeeding in delivering the highest quality of services and therefore are much more profitable from the investor’s point of view.</p><h3>Industry Selection</h3><p>Picking the artificial intelligence stocks to invest in could prove to be quite challenging. The current trends indicate that healthcare and manufacturing seem to be the most promising based on the projects launched or currently in development.</p><p>As the paradigm shifts to global health sustainability and healthcare systems move from illness management toward wellness maintenance, personalization of healthcare based on AI play a significant role. The increased availability of high-quality and comprehensive data is an essential growth factor and success driver of AI in healthcare. In particular, companies dealing with machine learning for <a href="https://pixelplex.io/work/artificial-intelligence-retina-disease-symptom-analyzer/">disease diagnosis</a> and drug discovery, natural language processing, and robotics should be among the top picks for long-term benefit investment.</p><p>AI stocks in the manufacturing industry also hold many opportunities for investment as they can capitalize on the vast amounts of data collected during the automation and develop smart maintenance, improved manufacturing processes, and human-robot collaboration.</p><h3>Data volume and quality</h3><p>Data is the foundation of all of the AI algorithms. As the research in mathematics and statistics is progressing, the algorithms are becoming more sophisticated and perform better than before. It is becoming more apparent that the real success of AI applications will be highly dependable on the amount and quality of collected data.</p><p>From the investor’s point of view, companies that own large and high-quality datasets will have a better chance to succeed in the market. Companies with a unique set of data are some of the best investment options as they have a higher prospect of delivering significant value to their customers. As the most comprehensive search engine, Google has access to massive datasets and can use them to produce unique AI systems. Likewise, Amazon owns data about customer’s shopping patterns and can deliver unique and profitable AI services.</p><h3>Ways of investing</h3><p>The most common way of investing in AI is by purchasing stocks of an AI company or a company that utilizes AI as part of their business. However, this is not the only way to invest in AI. There’s also a possibility to invest in ETFs and startups, as some of the candidates could have a much higher return on investment.</p><p>Investment in stocks of AI companies looks very similar to the traditional stock investment. Many companies use AI technology to create their products and services. The widespread adoption of AI technology will help these companies become successful, and in return, the value of their stocks will increase as well.</p><p>Most of the companies that specialize exclusively in developing AI products and services are relatively new to the market, and investing in them poses a high risk coupled with high gains. The less risky option is to invest in companies that use AI technology as a part of their business, such as Google, IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft. Companies that enable other companies to accumulate data also present valuable investment avenues.</p><p>The ETFs are investment funds traded on the stock exchanges, similar to stocks. ETFs are like a stock basket that meets a specific goal. Similarly, AI ETFs own public business shares in AI companies. ETFs investment offers certain advantages. They are easy to purchase, and there is no need to buy hundreds of different stocks to diversify one’s investment.</p><p>There is a professional management team behind the ETFs that actively trades stocks. Investors, therefore, are not involved in the cumbersome decision-making process. ETFs are also low cost and offer risk-mitigating diversification. The value of AI ETFs is likely to rise together with the widespread adoption of the technology.</p><p>As many of the AI companies have still not reached public offering, one of the ways to invest in them is through angel investing. Angel investors are the first to provide funding to a startup and get equity in the company in return. Artificial intelligence is an excellent opportunity for startups. Innovative startups employing AI technology emerge on the market every day. Once these startups succeed, they usually become very profitable, and angel investors have an excellent chance to avail return on their investments.</p><h2 id="the-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks">The best artificial intelligence stocks</h2><p><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks.jpg" alt="Two people standing on a podium next to a golden trophy and charts" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/><noscript><img src="https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks.jpg" alt="Two people standing on a podium next to a golden trophy and charts" width="1000" height="600" loading="lazy"/></noscript></p><p>Research is critical in deciding which stocks to invest in and choosing AI stocks demands the same determination.

Due to the technological versatility of AI, it is not being used just by software companies but also by retail companies, financial organizations, healthcare providers, educational institutions, and supply chain companies. One of the primary ways of investing is by purchasing stocks of these companies and organizations. Below are some essential factors to consider before trying to capitalize on AI projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAssociated risks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData is the principal input for artificial intelligence algorithms. In some applications, collecting and utilizing data to train machine learning models may involve privacy concerns. A known example of a company struggling with this issue is DeepMind. In 2016, the company agreed to gain access to health data from the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, which operates three London hospitals with around 1.6 million annual patients. This agreement led to \u003ca href=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2017/07/royal-free-google-deepmind-trial-failed-to-comply-with-data-protection-law/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ea legal battle\u003c/a\u003e as it was against the Data Protection Act.

Due to possible changes in these regulations and the complications related to maintaining compliance, investment in driverless car companies can be risky. Thorough research is necessary to understand the complex ethical dynamics of this industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubstantial risks are associated with investments in AI companies that are solving a broad scope of business problems. It is safer to invest in companies that limit their services to a specific market or target a specific type of client. Such companies have better chances of succeeding in delivering the highest quality of services and therefore are much more profitable from the investor’s point of view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIndustry Selection\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicking the artificial intelligence stocks to invest in could prove to be quite challenging. The current trends indicate that healthcare and manufacturing seem to be the most promising based on the projects launched or currently in development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the paradigm shifts to global health sustainability and healthcare systems move from illness management toward wellness maintenance, personalization of healthcare based on AI play a significant role. The increased availability of high-quality and comprehensive data is an essential growth factor and success driver of AI in healthcare. In particular, companies dealing with machine learning for \u003ca href=\"https://pixelplex.io/work/artificial-intelligence-retina-disease-symptom-analyzer/\"\u003edisease diagnosis\u003c/a\u003e and drug discovery, natural language processing, and robotics should be among the top picks for long-term benefit investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAI stocks in the manufacturing industry also hold many opportunities for investment as they can capitalize on the vast amounts of data collected during the automation and develop smart maintenance, improved manufacturing processes, and human-robot collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eData volume and quality\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData is the foundation of all of the AI algorithms. As the research in mathematics and statistics is progressing, the algorithms are becoming more sophisticated and perform better than before. It is becoming more apparent that the real success of AI applications will be highly dependable on the amount and quality of collected data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the investor’s point of view, companies that own large and high-quality datasets will have a better chance to succeed in the market. Companies with a unique set of data are some of the best investment options as they have a higher prospect of delivering significant value to their customers. As the most comprehensive search engine, Google has access to massive datasets and can use them to produce unique AI systems. Likewise, Amazon owns data about customer\u0026#8217;s shopping patterns and can deliver unique and profitable AI services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWays of investing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common way of investing in AI is by purchasing stocks of an AI company or a company that utilizes AI as part of their business. However, this is not the only way to invest in AI. There’s also a possibility to invest in ETFs and startups, as some of the candidates could have a much higher return on investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvestment in stocks of AI companies looks very similar to the traditional stock investment. Many companies use AI technology to create their products and services. The widespread adoption of AI technology will help these companies become successful, and in return, the value of their stocks will increase as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the companies that specialize exclusively in developing AI products and services are relatively new to the market, and investing in them poses a high risk coupled with high gains. The less risky option is to invest in companies that use AI technology as a part of their business, such as Google, IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft. Companies that enable other companies to accumulate data also present valuable investment avenues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ETFs are investment funds traded on the stock exchanges, similar to stocks. ETFs are like a stock basket that meets a specific goal. Similarly, AI ETFs own public business shares in AI companies. ETFs investment offers certain advantages. They are easy to purchase, and there is no need to buy hundreds of different stocks to diversify one’s investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a professional management team behind the ETFs that actively trades stocks. Investors, therefore, are not involved in the cumbersome decision-making process. ETFs are also low cost and offer risk-mitigating diversification. The value of AI ETFs is likely to rise together with the widespread adoption of the technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs many of the AI companies have still not reached public offering, one of the ways to invest in them is through angel investing. Angel investors are the first to provide funding to a startup and get equity in the company in return. Artificial intelligence is an excellent opportunity for startups. Innovative startups employing AI technology emerge on the market every day. Once these startups succeed, they usually become very profitable, and angel investors have an excellent chance to avail return on their investments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks\"\u003eThe best artificial intelligence stocks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks.jpg\" alt=\"Two people standing on a podium next to a golden trophy and charts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch is critical in deciding which stocks to invest in and choosing AI stocks demands the same determination.
