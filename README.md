# Insightful Blog Published On Swarm Decentralized Storage

Before anything, the web content are all from and the work of www.pixelplex.io .
This is the blog part of the website that has been carefully written and corrected by me.

**HOW TO USE**
- The blog content is available on the SWARM storage. You can access it here
https://bah5acgzaxoumluu2g7dmv7mtxgce6rmql2fyffdyjkqqulzhsjqove4vva6q.bzz.link/

Or

- Clone this Current repository to your desire directory
  - navigate to the ~/index.html 
  - and open on any browser.

**HOW IT WORKS**

You can also publish any existing blog by 
- Getting ready the code(html,css,js). For me, all the css and js are inline and referenced to the sites file
- Then publish to SWARM 
    There are two ways you can do that:
    - Use your BEE node (easiest)
    - or use the SWARM gateway - https://gateway.ethswarm.org/share (It is straightforward for files less than 10MB but requires some twisting for larger file)

    I used the latter for testing purposes.
    - The whole blog file was larger than 10mb but each pages were lesser.
    - So i uploaded each pages one by one and copied the link to each
    - and then link them together in my code.
    - You will need basic web programming to do this.

 It is easier if you use your own node. All information about that is here - https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/
